# ACT 1 - Scene 10: Flashback: Brothers on the Rooftop
# ======================================================


label act1_brothers:

    # VISUAL: Same rooftop as act1_09_breaking_point, but years earlier.
    # LIGHTING: Late afternoon—golden hour fading to dusk; warmer palette.
    # SOUND: Distant city hum; wind softer, less oppressive; no sirens.

    # NEW: Timeline context - CORRECTED
    a "{i}Before the ritual. Before the rejection. Before everything broke.{/i}"
    a "{i}Before Glass.{/i}"
    a "{i}There was a time when this rooftop felt like freedom.{/i}"
    a "{i}I was ten. Kael was fifteen. His Band had been working for three years.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Two figures seated at the rail—young Aeron (10) and his brother Kael (15).
    # Kael wears casual Aeries clothing; silver Band visible on his wrist, three years old.

    k "You ever think about what's past the edge?"
    ya "(looks out) Past Solveil?"
    k "Past everything. The ruins. The dead cities. Whatever's left out there."
    ya "Father says there's nothing. Just ash and ghosts."
    k "(smirks) Father says a lot of things."

    # NEW/REVISED: Kael's Band with nervous gesture - 3 years old, starting to fail
    # VISUAL: Kael's Band catches the fading sunlight—prismatic glint.
    "{i}His Band gleams. Three years old. Still working. Barely.{/i}"
    # VISUAL: Kael touches it absently—a gesture young Aeron doesn't understand yet.
    "{i}He touches it often. More than he used to. Like checking a wound.{/i}"

    ya "Does it still hurt?"
    k "(glances at his wrist) The Band? ...Sometimes. Lately."
    ya "Lately?"
    k "Started a few weeks ago. Like... pressure. From the inside."
    ya "(worried) Did you tell Father?"
    k "(bitter laugh) Tell Father his perfect son is glitching? No thanks."

    # VISUAL: Young Aeron stares at his own bare wrist.
    ya "{i}Two years. Two years until my turn.{/i}"
    ya "What if mine doesn't work?"
    k "It will. You're a Rylan."
    ya "So are you."
    k "(pause) ...Yeah. I am."

    # VISUAL: Kael stands, stretches, walks to the edge—closer than safe.
    ya "(alarmed) Kael—"
    k "(laughs) Relax. I'm not gonna jump."
    k "Just seeing how close I can get before instinct kicks in."

    # VISUAL: He stands at the very edge, arms spread, wind tugging at his sleeves.
    k "You know what's weird? Up here, I feel like I could actually fly."
    k "Like if I just... let go, the city would catch me."
    ya "(uneasy) That's not how physics works."
    k "(grins back at him) Physics. Listen to you, little professor."

    # VISUAL: Kael steps back from the edge, sits back down beside Aeron.
    "{i}Relief floods through young Aeron's chest.{/i}"

    # NEW/REVISED: Deeper "playing a part" exchange with Band failure context
    k "(serious now) You ever feel like you're not really... you?"
    ya "What do you mean?"
    k "Like... you're playing a part. Reading lines someone else wrote."
    ya "All the time."
    k "(nods slowly) Yeah. Me too."
    # VISUAL: Kael looks out at the city; jaw tight.
    k "(quieter) The Band was supposed to make me whole. Give me purpose."
    k "But lately... I don't know. Feels like it's taking something instead."
    ya "Taking what?"
    k "Me. The parts that used to be mine."
    k "(looks at his wrist) Sometimes I wonder what happens when you forget the lines."
    ya "You improvise?"
    k "(hollow laugh) Or you fall off the stage."

    # VISUAL: Silence; city lights begin to flicker on below as dusk deepens.
    "{i}The city wakes below them—a thousand lights igniting like distant stars.{/i}"

    # NEW/REVISED: More urgent promise moment with Glass foreshadowing
    k "Promise me something."
    ya "What?"
    k "If I ever lose myself—if the Band ever fails, or if I become something I'm not—you'll remember who I was."
    ya "(confused) Why would the Band fail? It's been working for three years."
    k "Nothing works forever. Not even faith."
    k "(grips young Aeron's shoulder) Just promise, Aeron."
    # VISUAL: Kael's hand grips young Aeron's shoulder—urgent, almost desperate.
    "{i}His grip is tight. Too tight. Then he lets go.{/i}"
    ya "(hesitant) ...I promise."
    k "(softer) And if Father ever tries to make you into something you're not..."
    k "...don't let him. Fight it. Stay you."
    ya "I don't understand."
    k "You will. Someday. Just... remember this conversation."

    # VISUAL: Kael's expression softens; he ruffles Aeron's hair—older brother affection.
    k "Good. 'Cause I'm gonna need someone to tell the truth when Father starts rewriting history."
    ya "(half-smile) You think he'd do that?"
    k "(dry laugh) I think he already has."

    # VISUAL: They sit in comfortable silence; wind carries distant music from below.
    k "Two years, huh? Then you'll get your Band."
    ya "Yeah."
    k "You scared?"
    ya "(honest) Terrified."
    k "Good. Means you're paying attention."
    # NEW: Warning about what comes after
    k "But listen... if it doesn't work. If the Band rejects you."
    k "Don't let Father turn you into a weapon just because you can't be a believer."
    ya "What?"
    k "Just... remember you're a person first. Not a tool."

    # VISUAL: Kael stands, offers his hand to pull Aeron up.
    k "Come on. Dinner's in twenty. Father hates it when we're late."
    ya "(takes his hand, stands) Kael?"
    k "Yeah?"
    ya "Thanks. For... this."
    k "(grins) Anytime, little brother. Anytime."

    # VISUAL: They walk toward the rooftop door together.
    # CAMERA: Hold on the empty rooftop as they leave—wind stirs, city hums.

    # TRANSITION: Slow dissolve to present-day rooftop—same angle, empty, colder lighting.
    a "{i}Six months later, his Band rejected him completely. Age fifteen.{/i}"
    a "{i}Father pulled strings. Kept him in the Aeries. Called it mercy.{/i}"
    a "{i}Kael called it a cage.{/i}"
    a "{i}The whispers followed him everywhere. 'Protected failure.' 'General's broken son.'{/i}"
    a "{i}Two years after that, he stood here alone. Age seventeen.{/i}"
    a "{i}And he jumped.{/i}"

    # NEW/REVISED: Explicit bridge to breaking point and Glass
    # VISUAL: Present-day Aeron standing at the same rail, same position Kael once stood.
    a "{i}I kept my promise. I remembered who you were.{/i}"
    a "{i}But I didn't understand what you meant. Not then.{/i}"
    
    # NEW: Understanding what Kael warned about
    a "{i}'Don't let Father turn you into a weapon,' you said.{/i}"
    a "{i}Two years after your jump, my Band failed. Age twelve.{/i}"
    a "{i}And Father did exactly what you warned me about.{/i}"
    a "{i}He made me Glass. Transparent. Empty. Useful.{/i}"
    a "{i}A weapon without faith. A tool without purpose.{/i}"
    a "{i}390 operations. Ten years of becoming what you told me to fight.{/i}"

    # NEW: Kael's prescience
    a "{i}The cage. The whispers. Father's 'mercy.' The weight of being saved when you wanted to fall.{/i}"
    a "{i}You knew. You knew what he'd do to me.{/i}"
    a "{i}You tried to warn me. And I didn't understand until it was too late.{/i}"
    
    # NEW: Glass breaking
    a "{i}But now... now Glass is cracking.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe I can still fight it. Maybe it's not too late.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe breaking is how I finally keep my promise to you.{/i}"

    "{i}The memory fades. But the weight remains.{/i}"
    "{i}Present day. His apartment.{/i}"
