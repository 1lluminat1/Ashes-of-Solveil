    # VISUAL: Academy training room – dusk lighting, hard shadow; simulated urban environment.
    # SOUND: Soft electric hum of projectors; distant simulation gunfire.
    a "{i}The past doesn’t ask permission. It just arrives.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: A younger Aeron (18) kneels behind cover—simulation weapon in hand, breath held.
    # VISUAL: Daren beside him—more polished, less anxious.
    cadet "Target left, two meters. Civilian profile."
    cadet "(tense) Wrong place, wrong time."
    cadet "Orders are clear. Clean sweep. No exceptions."

    # VISUAL: Aeron hesitates. Crosshairs hover. His finger lingers over the trigger.
    a "{i}I saw her. Just a girl. Simulation or not... she hesitated too.{/i}"
    cadet "(sharper) Aeron."

    # VISUAL: Aeron fires. Sim target drops. Silence.
    a "{i}Scored a hit. Passed the test.{/i}"
    a "{i}Daren smiled. The instructor nodded.{/i}"
    a "{i}And I looked at my hands, like they’d done it on their own.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Cut to instructor clipboard — “PASS: RYLAN, A.”
    a "{i}They called it decisive. Said I had potential.{/i}"
    a "{i}Said hesitation gets soldiers killed.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Final image — Aeron alone in the sim room, lights dimming.
    a "{i}That night, I stared at the wall until the lights went out.{/i}"
    a "{i}Trying to remember the girl’s face. I couldn’t.{/i}"
