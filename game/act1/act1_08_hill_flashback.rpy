# ACT 1 - Scene 8: Flashback: Aeron and Lyra on the Hill
# ======================================================


label act1_hill:
    # VISUAL: Golden hour over a grassy hill beyond the perimeter fence.
    # COSTUME: Academy uniforms, slightly scuffed from sneaking out.
    # SOUND: Soft wind; distant city hum; occasional perimeter buzz far away.
    # LIGHTING: Warm, low-angle sun; lens flare acceptable; soft rim on hair.

    a "{i}Years ago... before the branding. Before the silence. Before the weight of names.{/i}"
    a "{i}There was this hill. Far enough for trouble. Close enough to still matter.{/i}"
    a "{i}Rules never meant much to Lyra.{/i}"

    # CAMERA: Static two-shot seated, city in the far bokeh.
    l "If you could fly anywhere—no tech, no Band—just wings... where?"
    ya "Anywhere but here."
    l "Lame answer."
    ya "...Somewhere with real trees. Not the plastic ones."

    l "(grins) Nature boy, huh?"
    ya "Better than being stuck in a glass tower pretending it's perfect."

    # VISUAL: Lyra leans back on her hands; looks at the sky.
    l "You know what I hate most about the Aeries?"
    ya "The people?"
    l "(laughs) Well, yes. But also... the silence."
    ya "It's not silent. There's always music, chatter, broadcasts—"
    l "Exactly. Noise pretending to be life. But no one actually says anything real."

    # VISUAL: Young Aeron looks at her—something shifts in his expression.
    ya "You say real things."
    l "(surprised) Do I?"
    ya "All the time. It's kind of terrifying."
    l "(smiles) Good. Someone should be."

    # VISUAL: Wind moves through the grass; both watch it ripple like water.
    "{i}The grass bends and rises, a green ocean rolling under the sun.{/i}"

    ya "Do you ever think about what happens after?"
    l "After what?"
    ya "After we're Branded. After we're assigned. After we become... whatever they decide we are."
    l "(quiet) Every day."

    # VISUAL: She pulls a blade of grass, twirls it between her fingers.
    l "My mother says the Band will make me complete. That I'll finally understand my purpose."
    ya "Do you believe her?"
    l "(pause) ...I don't know. Do you believe your father?"
    ya "I don't know either."

    # VISUAL: Lyra's fingers still; the grass blade falls.
    l "(softly) What if the Band changes us?"
    ya "What do you mean?"
    l "What if it makes us into people we wouldn't recognize? People who don't... feel the same things."
    ya "(careful) Like what things?"

    # VISUAL: She looks at him directly; vulnerability breaking through her usual confidence.
    l "Like this. Sitting here. Saying real things. What if after the Branding, this becomes... frivolous?"
    ya "It's not frivolous."
    l "How do you know?"
    ya "Because nothing that matters is frivolous. And this matters."

    # VISUAL: Her expression softens; something unguarded appears.
    "{i}Her mask slips. Just for a moment. Something raw underneath.{/i}"

    l "(barely audible) Does it? Matter?"
    ya "To me it does."

    # VISUAL: Silence; the sun drops lower, painting everything gold.
    "{i}The light shifts. Everything glows. Like the world is holding its breath.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Their shoulders are close—almost touching. Neither pulls away.
    "{i}They sit closer now. Not quite touching. Almost.{/i}"

    l "What if we don't get Branded to the same division?"
    ya "Then we find each other anyway."
    l "You make it sound simple."
    ya "Isn't it?"
    l "(softly) I hope so."

    # VISUAL: Young Aeron shifts slightly; their shoulders touch.
    "{i}He moves. Just slightly. Their shoulders meet. Warm contact through fabric.{/i}"
    "{i}Neither pulls away.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) What are you most afraid of?"
    ya "Failing. You?"
    l "Succeeding."
    ya "(confused) Why would that scare you?"
    l "Because if I succeed at what they want, I might lose what I want."
    ya "What do you want?"
    l "(looks at him) I don't know yet. But I think... it's something like this."

    # VISUAL: The moment stretches; neither moves.
    "{i}The city hums in the distance. Up here, it feels like another world.{/i}"

    ya "We could come back here. After. No matter what happens."
    l "Promise?"
    ya "Promise."
    l "(small smile) Then I'll hold you to it."

    # NEW/REVISED: More visceral almost-touch
    # VISUAL: Lyra's hand rests in the grass between them; Aeron's hand inches closer.
    "{i}Her hand rests in the grass. His moves toward it—slow, uncertain.{/i}"
    # VISUAL: Fingers almost touch—close enough to feel the warmth.
    "{i}The space between them narrows. An inch. Less.{/i}"
    # VISUAL: Then Lyra pulls away, standing suddenly.
    l "(standing quickly) We should head back before they notice we're gone."
    ya "(disappointed) Yeah. Probably."

    # BLOCKING: Lyra pops up to stand; offers hand.
    l "Then we'll run away someday. You and me."
    ya "You serious?"
    l "(nods) Dead serious."

    ya "{i}Back then it felt real. Like we could run and leave the city behind. No father. No duty. Just wind.{/i}"

    l "Promise me—if the world turns to ash, we still find a place like this. Ours."
    ya "(softly) I promise."

    # VISUAL: Lyra pulls him to his feet; they stand face to face, close.
    "{i}She pulls him up. For a moment, they stand too close. Eyes meet.{/i}"

    l "(barely a whisper) Don't forget me. When everything changes."
    ya "I won't. I couldn't."
    l "(sad smile) Everyone says that."
    ya "I'm not everyone."
    l "(touches his arm briefly) No. You're not."

    # NEW: Physical lingering
    # VISUAL: Her hand lingers for a heartbeat—then lets go.
    "{i}Her fingers slip away. The warmth remains.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: She steps back; the moment breaks but doesn't shatter.
    "{i}She steps back. The moment hangs in the air like the last note of a song.{/i}"

    # CAMERA: Close on clasped hands; grass moving in wind.
    a "{i}For a moment, the city didn't exist. Just us, and the wind.{/i}"
    a "{i}I should have held tighter to that moment.{/i}"

    # NEW: Connection to broken promises
    a "{i}We promised to find a place like that hill. Somewhere ours.{/i}"
    a "{i}Instead, we found duty. Orders. Distance.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Gentle white bloom → next flashback.
    a "{i}Then the day came—two years later, the Branding Ritual—and everything changed.{/i}"
