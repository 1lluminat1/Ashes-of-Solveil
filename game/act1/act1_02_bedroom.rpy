    # CAMERA: Wide static shot of the room — cold blue spill from the floor-to-ceiling glass, no character in frame.
    # LIGHTING: Cold blue wash from outside. Faint flicker of distant signage below the cloud layer.
    # SOUND: High-altitude wind scraping the exterior. Low mechanical hum in the walls.

    # cann: ===============================
    # cann.scene_id:
    #   act1_02_mission_order  (Act I — Scene 2A)

    # cann.when_in_timeline:
    #   Immediately before the Sector 7 mission; Aeron receives Operation 390 orders.
    #   Anchors the transition from introspection to field execution.

    # cann.what_happened (objective canon summary):
    #   - Aeron receives his 390th mission order: Sector Seven containment sweep.
    #   - Exhibits total procedural obedience; emotion reduced to ritual habit.
    #   - “Glass” identity solidified as systemic function, not individuality.
    #   - Final lines (“First the blade. Then the smile.”) emphasize performance motif.
    #   - First flicker of doubt appears in the line “Glass doesn’t break … does it?”

    # cann.aeron_state:
    #   OB-lean read:
    #     Fully conditioned soldier; obedience equated with purpose; detached and precise.
    #   EMP-lean read:
    #     Minimal deviation — faint questioning impulse present but instantly repressed.
    #   Neutral (pre-lock) summary:
    #     Disassociated, procedural cognition; perceives self as extension of Echelon’s order.

    # cann.path_tracking:
    #   empathy_score_range_so_far:
    #     min_emp_possible: -1   # from “Say it anyway”
    #     max_emp_possible:  1   # from “Stay silent”
    #   notes:
    #     - This choice seeds the first minor path_pressure adjustment (×1 weight).
    #     - Establishes baseline for later empathy/obedience divergence during Act I.

    # cann.thematic_flags:
    #   motifs_used:
    #     - Glass / Performance / Routine vs Identity
    #   recurring_lines_seeded:
    #     - “Glass doesn’t break … does it?”   /   “First the blade. Then the smile.”
    #   continuity_asserts:
    #     - Operation count = 389 completed → 390 pending.
    #     - Kael failed at 15 → survived 3 years → suicide at 17.
    #     - Mission framed as ordinary containment (not exceptional).

    # cann.block_status:
    #   anchor_or_variant:
    #     ANCHOR   # establishes Aeron’s identity foundation; flavor diverges later
    #   requires_followup:
    #     - act1_02b_sector7_mission  (execution of Operation 390)
