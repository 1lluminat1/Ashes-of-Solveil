# ACT 1 - Scene 14: Marcus Holo-Call Debrief
# =======================================================


label act1_marcus_call:
    # VISUAL: Aeron’s apartment — sterile, blue-white; auto lights rise as door seals
    # UI: Holo-console auto-activates on proximity
    "{i}Later that night, Aeron's room.{/i}"
    "{i}The door seals behind him. The room wakes on its own — a ritual of obedient light.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Holo projection warms; Marcus already on the line
    # SFX: Soft holo-pop, line stabilizes with faint distortion
    m "You’re late."

    a "Recon took longer. Sector Ten’s grid is noisier than your brief suggested."

    m "Sector Ten was {i}reconnaissance{/i}, not conversation. You were sent to observe, not to collect folk tales."

    a "Then the folk tales are loud. Schedules don’t match the traffic. Checkpoint rotations slipped. Power dips aren’t random."

    m "You’re not paid to divine patterns, Aeron. You’re paid to {i}maintain{/i} them."

    a "If maintenance keeps breaking the machine—"

    m "Finish your report. Upload whatever you scraped, and don’t editorialize."

    # VISUAL: Marcus leans closer; colder tone, hint of personal bleed-through
    m "There were complaints you ‘lingered’ on the lower spans. Explain."

    a "Weather. And interest."

    m "Interest in what?"

    a "In why the Unders are bracing like they know something I don’t."

    # VISUAL: Brief holo static across Marcus's face (symbolic fracture)
    m "You don’t need to know, you need to obey. That is what keeps you alive. That is what keeps {i}everyone{/i} alive."

    a "You ever wonder if that’s the thing bleeding them out?"

    # SFX: Line micro-clip; breath hangs
    m "We’ll talk when you remember who you are."

    # VISUAL: Holo snaps dark; apartment automatically dims to ‘energy save’
    "{i}Silence. The room inhales and dims, as if the walls are relieved to stop listening.{/i}"

    a "{i}‘Remember who you are.’ I'm trying.{/i}"

    # CUT: Hard cut to roof access hatch
