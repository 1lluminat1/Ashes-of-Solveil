    # The palette should shift from white → steel → blue → amber.

    "{i}Echelon keeps the peace with pageantry and power—relics tamed into Aether Bands.{/i}"
    "{i}Some call them gifts. Others, shackles. Obedience makes the difference.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Fade to black; single ember glows. 
    # Color shift from cold white to faint orange—symbol of hidden humanity.

    "{i}Some truths wait in the glass for someone willing to look.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Kael touches it absently—a gesture young Aeron doesn't understand yet.

    ya "Does it still hurt?"
    k "(glances at his wrist) The Band? ...Sometimes. Lately."
    ya "Lately?"
    k "Started a few weeks ago. Like... pressure. From the inside."

    k "Like if I just... let go, the city would catch me."

    k "(dry laugh) I think he already has."

    # SOUND: Raw, ugly sobbing. Not quiet. LOUD. Broken. Choking.

    "{i}Ten years of silence shatters.{/i}"
    "{i}Ten years of Glass cracks wide open.{/i}"
    "{i}And the flood pours out.{/i}"

    a "(sobbing) I'm sorry—I'm sorry—I'm so sorry—"
    a "I tried—I tried to save them—but it wasn't enough—"
    a "It's never enough—it's NEVER—"

    # VISUAL: He's hyperventilating. Can't breathe. Chest heaving.
    "{i}He can't breathe. Air won't come. Chest crushes. Lungs scream.{/i}"

    a "(gasping) I can't—I can't breathe—there's blood—everywhere—"
    a "On my hands—on my uniform—in my head—I can't—"

    # VISUAL: Lyra drops beside him. On the floor. Doesn't hesitate.
    # Her arms wrap around him—not romantic. Just human. Just holding.

    l "(quiet) Breathe. Just breathe. I'm here."

    # VISUAL: He collapses against her. Full weight. Can't hold himself up.
    # Sobs wracking his entire body. Violent. Uncontrolled.

    a "(barely coherent) How do you—how do you live with it—"
    a "How do you—breathe—after—after—"
    a "I see their faces—every time I close my eyes—"
    a "The child—the vendor—the families—all of them—"

    # VISUAL: His hands clutch at his chest. Clawing. Like he can rip the guilt out.
    "{i}His hands claw at his chest. Trying to tear it out. The guilt. The horror.{/i}"

    a "I'm not Glass—I'm not—I can FEEL it—"
    a "Every death—every face—every person I—"
    a "(screaming) I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS ANYMORE—"

    # PHASE 5: LYRA BREAKS WITH HIM

    # VISUAL: Lyra's composure cracks. Her eyes fill. Her breath catches.
    "{i}Lyra's mask shatters. Tears stream. She can't hold it either.{/i}"

    l "(voice breaking) I know. I know. I've done it too."
    l "Sector 7. Before the gala. Compliance audit."
    l "I found children. Families. Just surviving."
    l "And I—I logged them. Reported them. Did my duty."
    l "(crying) Three days later they were gone. Relocated. Erased."
    l "I told myself it was necessary. That the system knew better."
    l "(sobbing) But I can't stop seeing their faces either."

    # VISUAL: She holds him tighter. Both of them shaking. Both crying.
    "{i}She holds him. And breaks with him. Two pieces of Glass shattering together.{/i}"

    l "We're not Glass. We were never just Glass."
    l "We're human. And humans feel. And it HURTS."
    l "(through tears) But feeling it means we're still alive."

    a "(sobbing into her shoulder) I can't—I can't do this anymore—"
    a "I can't be his weapon—I can't kill for him—I can't—"
    l "Then don't. You don't have to."
    a "He OWNS me—the system owns me—I can't—"
    l "(fierce) Then we break free. Together."

    # VISUAL: They sit on the floor. Holding each other. Both crying.
    # Time stretches. Minutes? Hours? Doesn't matter.

    "{i}They sit in the ruins of Glass. Both shattered. Both bleeding.{/i}"
    "{i}Time dissolves. Just breath. Just tears. Just being human.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: His sobs gradually quiet. Exhaustion taking over.
    # Breathing slows. Tears still falling but softer now.

    "{i}The storm passes. Slowly. Like bleeding out.{/i}"
    "{i}His sobs fade to shudders. Breath steadies. Body exhausted.{/i}"

    # PHASE 6: AFTER THE STORM

    # VISUAL: They sit against the wall now. Side by side. Faces wet. Eyes hollow.
    # Silence except breathing. Neither has words left.

    "{i}Silence settles. Not peace. Just emptiness after the flood.{/i}"

    l "(hoarse) How do you feel?"
    a "(barely audible) ...Empty."
    l "Good."
    a "...What?"
    l "You needed to be empty. To drain the poison."
    l "Ten years of holding it in. You couldn't carry it anymore."

    # VISUAL: He looks at her. Eyes red. Face streaked. Broken.
    a "I killed 600 people today."
    l "I know."
    a "How do I live with that?"
    l "(quiet) I don't know. But maybe... we learn together."

    # VISUAL: She takes his hand. Holds it. Not romantic. Just grounding.
    "{i}Her hand finds his. Holds tight. Anchor in the void.{/i}"

    l "You tried to save them. That's more than Glass would do."
    a "I didn't save enough."
    l "No one could have."
    a "Then what was the point?"
    l "(looks at him) The point is you TRIED. You fought the orders from within."
    l "You warned them. You faked reports. You showed mercy."
    l "That's not Glass. That's human."

    # VISUAL: His eyes close. Tears still leaking. Exhaustion crushing.
    a "I'm so tired, Lyra."
    l "I know."
    a "I don't know how to keep going."
    l "Then don't. Not tonight."
    l "(softer) Tonight, just breathe. Just exist."
    l "Tomorrow we figure out what comes next."

    # VISUAL: He leans his head back against wall. Completely spent.
    a "What if I can't be fixed?"
    l "Then we're broken together."
    l "(squeezes his hand) Glass recognizes glass. Remember?"
    l "But we're not Glass anymore. We're just... us."
    l "Broken. Guilty. Human."

    # VISUAL: They sit in silence. City lights through window. Time passes.
    "{i}They sit. The city hums beyond the glass. Neither moves.{/i}"
    "{i}Both too exhausted. Both too broken. Both too human.{/i}"

    a "(barely a whisper) Thank you."
    l "For what?"
    a "For being here. For not running. For..."
    a "...for seeing me. Not Glass. Me."
    l "(tears falling again) I see you. I've always seen you."
    l "Even when you couldn't see yourself."

    # VISUAL: She shifts closer. Her head rests on his shoulder.
    # Not romantic. Just exhausted humans holding each other up.

    "{i}She leans against him. He doesn't pull away.{/i}"
    "{i}Two pieces of broken glass, holding each other together.{/i}"

    l "We'll get through this."
    a "How can you be sure?"
    l "I'm not. But we'll try."
    l "(soft) And trying is all we have left."

    # VISUAL: Window shows evening deepening. Time passing. They don't move.
    "{i}Evening falls. The room darkens. Neither moves to turn on lights.{/i}"
    "{i}Just sitting. Just breathing. Just surviving the moment.{/i}"

    a "{i}Operation 391 is complete.{/i}"
    a "{i}Glass shattered on the floor of my apartment.{/i}"
    a "{i}And for the first time in ten years... I felt it all.{/i}"
    a "{i}Every death. Every face. Every crack.{/i}"
    a "{i}I'm not Glass anymore. I don't know what I am.{/i}"
    a "{i}But Lyra's here. And that's enough. For now.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Hold on them sitting together. Broken but not alone.
    # SOUND: Breathing. City hum. Silence between.

    "{i}They sit in the ruins of who they were.{/i}"
    "{i}Neither knows what comes next.{/i}"
    "{i}But they're not facing it alone.{/i}"

# ACT 1 - Scene 18b: Morning After Confession
# =======================================================

label act1_morning_after_confession:

    # VISUAL: Aeron's apartment. Morning light harsh through window. Floor, not bed.
    # LIGHTING: Cold morning white; unforgiving, exposing, nowhere to hide.
    # SOUND: City hum distant; his breathing; her breathing; silence between.

    "{i}Morning light cuts through the window. Sharp. Unforgiving.{/i}"
    "{i}He wakes slowly. Floor hard beneath him. Something warm against his side.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra on floor where they collapsed last night. Still dressed.
    # Body language: Tangled together (not romantic, just survival). Exhausted. Raw. Added intimacy: Legs entwined from sleep, her hand on his chest unconsciously.

    "{i}Lyra. Still here. Face pressed into his shoulder. Our legs tangled, her hand resting on my chest—like we held on through the night without words.{/i}"
    "{i}Dark circles under her eyes. Even in sleep, tension in her jaw. But her breath... warm against my skin.{/i}"

    a "{i}We fell asleep here. On the floor. Too exhausted to move.{/i}"
    a "{i}Too broken to care. But this closeness... it's something real in the ruin.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Her face in morning light—mascara smudged, hair disheveled, mask completely gone.
    a "{i}I've never seen her like this. Unguarded. Undone.{/i}"
    a "{i}No performance. No polish. Just... her. Beautiful in the breaking.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He tries to move without waking her. Fails.
    # SOUND: Soft intake of breath; her stirring.

    "{i}He shifts. She stirs. Eyes open slowly. Her hand tightens on his shirt briefly, instinctive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra wakes—momentary confusion, then awareness, then brief panic. Added: Lingering closeness as she doesn't pull away immediately.

    l "(disoriented) I—where—"
    
    # VISUAL: She tries to sit up quickly. Body protests. Winces.
    "{i}She tries to rise. Too fast. Body locks. Pain visible. But she doesn't untangle fully—our legs still brush, warmth lingering.{/i}"

    a "(gentle) Easy. We're in my apartment. Floor. You fell asleep."
    l "(remembering, quiet) ...Oh."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Both processing. Morning after breakdown. Nowhere to hide.
    "{i}Silence settles. Morning after. Everything exposed. Her breath quickens, close enough to feel.{/i}"

    l "(attempting composure) I should go. I have—"
    "{i}Her voice cracks. She stops. Can't finish.{/i}"

    a "Lyra."
    l "(not looking at him) I'm fine. I just need—"

    # VISUAL: Her hands shake. She clasps them together. Doesn't help.
    "{i}Her hands tremble. She clasps them. Still shaking.{/i}"

    a "You're not fine."
    l "(quiet) ...No. I'm not."

    # VISUAL: She looks at him. Raw. Vulnerable. No energy left for masks. Added: Eyes meet, a spark of unspoken pull.

    "{i}She meets his eyes. No mask. No polish. Just exhaustion. And something else—need, raw and unspoken.{/i}"

    l "How do you do this? Exist like this? Without the performance?"
    a "I don't know. I only learned yesterday."
    l "(hollow laugh) And look how well that's working."

    # VISUAL: Both sitting on floor. Backs against wall. Too tired to stand. Added intimacy: Shoulders brush as they shift closer instinctively.

    "{i}They sit against the wall. Floor hard. Bodies aching. Neither moves. Shoulders touch—grounding, warm in the cold light.{/i}"

    a "When did you last sleep? Really sleep?"
    l "(pause) ...I don't remember."
    a "Lyra—"
    l "Weeks. Maybe. I close my eyes and—"
    "{i}She stops. Breath catches. Can't continue. Her shoulder leans into his, seeking anchor.{/i}"

    a "You see them."
    l "(quiet) Every time."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Shared understanding. Both haunted.
    "{i}Silence. They both know. Faces that won't leave. Breaths syncing, slow and shared.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron notices something—her hand moves to her wrist. Touches Band. Unconscious.
    "{i}Her hand moves. Wrist. Fingers brush the Band. Checking.{/i}"
    "{i}He's seen her do this before. But now... now he's watching.{/i}"

    a "Your Band. You keep touching it."
    
    # VISUAL: Lyra realizes. Pulls hand away quickly. Defensive.
    l "(realizes, pulls hand away) I don't—"
    a "How often?"
    l "(defensive) It's nothing. Just a habit."
    a "Lyra."

    # VISUAL: She looks away. Jaw tight. Doesn't want to talk about it.
    l "(quiet) ...All the time. I don't even notice anymore."
    a "Why?"

    # VISUAL: Long pause. She debates. Then decides—partial truth only.
    l "(long pause) Making sure it's still there. Still working."
    a "Why wouldn't it be?"
    l "Because..." 
    "{i}She trails off. Can't say more. Too much. Her hand finds his arm instead—grip light, seeking contact.{/i}"

    a "Because what?"
    l "(shakes head) It's nothing. Paranoia. Ignore me."
    a "I'm not ignoring you."

    # VISUAL: She looks at him. Something breaks. Small crack.
    l "(barely audible) Because if it fails... I'm nothing."
    a "That's not true—"
    l "(sharp) Yes it is. Without this Band, I'm worthless. Disposable. Forgotten."
    l "You know that. You've lived it."

    # VISUAL: Aeron goes quiet. She's right. He knows.
    "{i}He has no answer. She's right. He lived it.{/i}"

    a "(quiet) The Band doesn't define worth."
    l "(bitter laugh) Says the person whose father made you a weapon to prove otherwise."
    
    # VISUAL: Silence. Truth cutting both ways.
    "{i}Silence. The truth cuts both ways.{/i}"

    l "(softer) I'm sorry. That was—"
    a "True. It was true."

    # VISUAL: She closes her eyes. Exhaustion overwhelming.
    l "I can't do this. I can't think. I can't—"

    a "When did you last eat?"
    l "(pause) ...Yesterday. Maybe."
    a "Lyra—"
    l "I can't. Food doesn't... I can't keep anything down."

    # VISUAL: Her hand touches her stomach briefly. Unconscious. Stress response.
    "{i}Her hand touches her stomach. Brief. Unconscious.{/i}"
    "{i}Stress. Trauma. Body rejecting everything.{/i}"

    a "At least drink something. Water. Coffee."
    l "(small nod) Coffee. I can try coffee."

    # VISUAL: He stands. Moves to small kitchenette. She stays on floor.
    "{i}He stands. Moves to make coffee. She stays on floor.{/i}"
    "{i}Too tired to move. Or too afraid to trust her legs.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: While making coffee, he watches her. Hand moves to Band again. Checking.
    "{i}Her hand moves again. Wrist. Band. Checking. Compulsive.{/i}"
    "{i}She doesn't notice. Automatic. Constant.{/i}"

    a "{i}How many times a day? Dozens? Hundreds?{/i}"
    a "{i}She's terrified of something. Something about that Band.{/i}"
    a "{i}But what?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He returns with coffee. Hands it to her. She takes it with shaking hands. Added: Fingers brush as he hands it over, a spark of warmth.

    "{i}He brings coffee. Hands it to her. Fingers brush—accidental, but the touch lingers a second too long. Warmth in the cold.{/i}"
    "{i}She steadies cup with both hands. Careful not to spill.{/i}"

    l "Thank you."
    a "Don't thank me. Just drink."

    # VISUAL: She sips. Small. Careful. Body accepting it, barely.
    "{i}She sips. Slowly. Body fighting it. But stays down.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) I lied to you. Last night."
    a "About what?"
    l "Sector 7."

    # VISUAL: Aeron sits beside her. Listening. Not pushing.
    "{i}He sits. Close but not touching. Listening.{/i}"

    l "I said I logged the families. Reported them. Let others... do the rest."
    a "..."
    l "(voice breaking) That wasn't true."

    # VISUAL: She stares into coffee. Can't look at him.
    "{i}She stares into the cup. Can't meet his eyes.{/i}"

    l "I didn't just log them. I executed them."
    l "Compliance audit. Direct termination protocol."
    l "They gave me the weapon. The list. The orders."
    l "(barely audible) And I obeyed."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Heavy. Crushing.
    "{i}Silence. Heavy as stone.{/i}"

    a "How many?"
    l "Twelve families. Thirty-eight people total."
    l "Including..." 
    "{i}Her voice breaks. Can't finish.{/i}"
    l "...seven children."

    # VISUAL: Coffee cup trembles in her hands. Spills slightly. She doesn't notice.
    "{i}The cup shakes. Coffee spills on her hand. She doesn't feel it.{/i}"

    a "(takes cup from her, sets it aside) Lyra—"
    l "I told myself they were relocated. Gave myself the mercy of that lie."
    l "But I remember the sounds. The looks. The—"
    "{i}She can't continue. Gasping. Hyperventilating.{/i}"

    a "(moves closer) Breathe. Just breathe."
    l "I CAN'T. Every time I close my eyes I see them—"

    # VISUAL: He doesn't try to fix it. Just sits. Presence. Witness. Added intimacy: He takes her hand gently, grounding her breath.

    "{i}He doesn't speak. Just sits. Takes her hand—gentle, not demanding. Her fingers curl into his, holding on like a lifeline. Breaths sync, slow and shared.{/i}"
    "{i}Like she did for him yesterday.{/i}"

    l "(through tears) You killed 600. I killed 38."
    l "Your horror is bigger. But mine is..."
    l "...mine is mine. And I can't—I can't—"

    a "It's not a competition. Guilt doesn't work that way."
    l "Then how does it work?"
    a "It doesn't. It just... crushes. Until you can't breathe."
    l "(whisper) I can't breathe."
    a "I know."

    # VISUAL: He moves closer. Not holding her. Just beside her. Present.
    "{i}He shifts closer. Shoulder touching shoulder. Grounding.{/i}"

    l "Sector 7 wasn't the first time."
    a "..."
    l "There was another mission. Years ago. Before I became... this."

    # VISUAL: She looks at him. Something deeper visible. Then walls up again.
    "{i}She looks at him. Something raw. Then shuts down.{/i}"

    l "I don't want to talk about it."
    a "Okay."
    l "Not yet. Maybe not ever."
    a "That's okay too."

    # VISUAL: Silence. She expected pushing. Got acceptance instead.
    "{i}Silence. She expected pressure. Got space instead.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) Thank you."
    a "For what?"
    l "For not making me explain."
    a "I know what it's like. Carrying something too heavy to voice."

    # VISUAL: Her hand moves to Band again. Checking. She catches herself this time.
    "{i}Her hand moves. Wrist. Band. She notices. Stops.{/i}"
    "{i}Looks at her hand. Confused by her own compulsion.{/i}"

    l "(staring at her hand) Why do I keep doing that?"
    a "I don't know. Do you?"
    l "(long pause) ...I'm afraid."
    a "Of what?"
    l "That it'll stop working. That I'll become... nothing."

    # VISUAL: She looks at him. Real fear visible. Not about mission. Something deeper.
    "{i}Real fear. Not performance. Not deflection. Terror.{/i}"

    a "The Band doesn't make you something. You already are."
    l "Am I? Or am I just what the Band lets me be?"
    a "Lyra—"
    l "(shakes head) I don't know anymore. I don't know where I end and the Band begins."

    # VISUAL: She stands abruptly. Needs to move. Needs to escape the conversation.
    "{i}She stands. Fast. Needs movement. Needs escape.{/i}"

    l "I have to go. Council meeting. Performance required."
    a "Can you do it? After last night?"
    l "(steadies herself) I have to."

    # VISUAL: She smooths hair. Straightens posture. Mask sliding back into place.
    "{i}She smooths her hair. Straightens spine. Mask returning.{/i}"
    "{i}Before his eyes, she transforms. Lyra the Weapon restored.{/i}"

    l "(formal voice) Thank you for... last night. And this morning."
    a "Lyra, you don't have to—"
    l "(softer, real voice breaking through) I know. But if I don't practice the mask now..."

    # VISUAL: She trails off. Looks at him. Something raw breaking through polish.
    "{i}She stops. Looks at him. Mask cracks. Just for a second.{/i}"

    l "(quietly) Do you see them? When you close your eyes?"
    a "Every time."
    l "Me too."
    l "(barely audible) Does it ever stop?"
    a "I don't know. I hope so."
    l "...I hope so too."

    # VISUAL: She moves toward door. Stops. Doesn't turn around.
    "{i}She walks to the door. Stops. Hand on handle.{/i}"

    l "(without turning) Tonight. After your meeting with Zira. Find me."
    a "Where?"
    l "I'll find you. I always do."

    # NEW: Choice-gated hug moment. Aeron calls her back as she reaches for the door.

        "Call her back." if aeron_empathy >= 2:  # Gate to empathy flag for earned intimacy.
            $ lyra_trust += 1
            a "Lyra—wait."
            "{i}She pauses, hand on the handle. Doesn't turn, but her shoulders tense.{/i}"
            "{i}He stands, closes the distance. Gentle—calls her name again, softer.{/i}"
            a "(quiet) Lyra."
            "{i}She turns slowly. Eyes meet. No words needed.{/i}"
            "{i}He pulls her into a hug—careful, not demanding. Arms around her, holding the pieces together.{/i}"
            l "(stiff at first, then softens) Aeron..."
            "{i}She melts into it. Head on his shoulder, breath warm against his neck. Hands clutch his back.{/i}"
            "{i}No rush. Just presence. Heartbeats syncing, a quiet promise in the touch.{/i}"
            a "{i}She's warm. Real. Broken but here. And for a moment, the world fades.{/i}"
            l "(whisper) I needed this."
            a "(quiet) Me too."
            "{i}They part slowly. Eyes linger—a spark unspoken.{/i}"
            l "(small smile) Tonight."
            a "Tonight."

        "Let her go.":
            "{i}He watches her leave. Door clicks shut. Silence returns, heavier now.{/i}"
            a "{i}Maybe next time. When we're both ready.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door closes. Silence returns.
    "{i}The door closes. Silence floods back.{/i}"
    "{i}He's alone. She's gone. But something changed.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron sits on floor. Processes. Her coffee still on ground, cold.
    a "{i}She's been barely holding on. Just like me.{/i}"
    a "{i}All this time I thought she was saving me.{/i}"
    a "{i}But we've been saving each other.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He notices—on the floor where she sat, a small drop of coffee. And blood.
    # Her hand where the hot coffee spilled. She didn't even feel it.
    "{i}Coffee spilled where she sat. And something else.{/i}"
    "{i}Blood. Small drop. Her hand. She didn't even notice.{/i}"
    "{i}Pain doesn't register when you're already drowning.{/i}"

    a "{i}38 people. 7 children. And something before that. Something worse.{/i}"
    a "{i}Her Band compulsion. Her terror. Her mask.{/i}"
    a "{i}She's not just broken. She's terrified of breaking more.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He looks at his own bare wrist. Then at the door she left through.
    a "{i}No Band. No worth. That's what the system teaches.{/i}"
    a "{i}I learned that at twelve. Failed and forgotten.{/i}"
    a "{i}But she has hers. And she's still terrified.{/i}"
    a "{i}What happened to make her fear it so much?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Window shows morning light. City waking. Day beginning.
    "{i}The city wakes beyond the glass. Another day. Another performance.{/i}"

    a "{i}Glass recognizes glass. Broken recognizes broken.{/i}"
    a "{i}We're both drowning. But at least we're drowning together.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe that's enough. For now.{/i}"

    l "Those sectors have been acting strange. Energy readings. Troop movements."
    a "You noticed too?"
    l "Hard not to. It feels like... preparation."
    a "For what?"
    l "I don't know. But something big."

    # VISUAL: Dread creeping back in. But they push it away. Not yet. Not now.
    a "Let's not think about it. Not right now."

    # VISUAL: He doesn't move. Staring at burning sectors. Catatonic.

    a "(quiet) Revenge."
    l "Yes. They did this. Marcus. The Directorate. Echelon."
    l "They ordered this. They pushed the button. They killed hundreds of thousands."
    l "(fierce) NOT YOU. THEM."

    l "Yes."
    a "Father did this."
    l "Yes."
    a "And he wanted me to watch. To learn. To obey."
    l "Yes."

    "{i}He stands. Different. Colder. Harder. Not Glass. Something new.{/i}"

    a "Glass followed orders. Glass showed mercy. Glass failed."
    a "So no more Glass. No more mercy. No more obedience."
    a "(looks at burning sectors) Just ash. And those who made it."

    # VISUAL: Lyra stands beside him. Both watching the fires. Both changed.
    l "What do we do?"
    a "We burn them back."
    a "Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon."
    a "We learn. We prepare. We find every crack in the system."
    a "And we shatter it from within."

    # TEXT: "THE GLASS HAS SHATTERED"

    # canon_note: Purge happens exactly at 2000 hours (when Marcus scheduled observation)
    # canon_note: Aeron realizes his mercy triggered acceleration (tragic irony complete)
    # canon_note: Both Aeron and Lyra witness together (shared trauma, shared rage)
    # canon_note: Tentative hope destroyed immediately (maximum emotional impact)
    # canon_note: Aeron's guilt multiplied infinitely (600 → 200 saved → 100,000s killed)
    # canon_note: "Glass was right" moment (system punishes humanity, proves obedience)
    # canon_note: BUT: Transforms into rage/resistance rather than surrender
    # canon_note: Lyra redirects his guilt toward system ("NOT YOU. THEM.")
    # canon_note: "We burn them back" = thesis for Act 2
    # canon_note: No longer Glass, no longer human, just "ash waiting to burn"
    # canon_note: ACT 1 END - Complete transformation, lowest point, ready to rise
