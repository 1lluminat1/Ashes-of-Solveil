# ACT 1 - Scene 7: Flashback: Aeron and Lyra on the Hill
# ======================================================


label act1_hill:
    # VISUAL: Gentle golden hour glow over a grassy hill. 
    # Wind brushes through wildflowers. Aeron (age 11) and Lyra (age 11) sit overlooking the sprawl of Solveil from a distance. 
    # They wear academy uniforms, slightly scuffed from sneaking out.
    a "{i}Years ago... before the branding, before the silence, before the weight of names and legacies...{/i}"
    a "{i}...there was this hill. Just outside the security perimeter, far enough for trouble, close enough to still matter.{/i}"
    a "{i}We weren't supposed to be there. But rules never meant much to Lyra.{/i}"

    # Young Lyra tosses a rock down the slope. Young Aeron mimics her.
    l "If you could fly anywhere—right now, no tech, no band—just wings... where would you go?"
    ya "Anywhere but here."

    l "Lame answer. Try again."
    ya "...Somewhere with real trees. Not these synthetic plastic ones."

    l "(grins) So you're a nature boy, huh?"
    ya "Better than being stuck in a glass tower pretending everything's perfect."

    l "Then we’ll run away someday. You and me."
    ya "You serious?"

    l "(nods) Dead serious."
    ya "{i}Back then, it felt real. Like we could just... run. Leave the city behind. No father. No duty. Just two kids chasing the wind.{/i}"

    # Lyra stands and offers her hand to Aeron.
    l "Promise me—if the world ever turns to shit, we'll still find a place like this. Just ours."
    ya "(softly) I promise."

    # Their hands clasp—two children grasping something bigger than they understand.
    a "{i}For a moment, the city didn’t exist. Just us, and the sound of the wind.{/i}"
    a "{i}I should’ve held on tighter to that moment.{/i}"

    # Fade to white, leading into next flashback.
    a "{i}But then, on that day... it all turned to shit...{/i}"
