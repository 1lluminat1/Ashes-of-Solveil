# ===================================================


label act1_intro:
    # VISUAL: A scorched earth. Collapsed cities. Twisted metal. Fires still burning.
    "{i}Long ago, the world fractured beneath the weight of its own ambition.{/i}"
    "{i}Cities fell. Nations crumbled. From the ashes rose a single bastion of order—Solveil.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: The upper levels of Solveil, gleaming above the clouds.
    "{i}A city-state built skyward upon the bones of the old world.{/i}"
    "{i}At its peak: the Aeries—seat of power, privilege, and control. Where the elites rule from spires that pierce the clouds, shining only because everything beneath them burns.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: The Middle Levels—dense, industrial, alive with motion.
    "{i}Beneath them lies the Middle Levels: crucible of labor and law. A restless machine of commerce and obedience.{/i}"
    "{i}Here, the working class fuels the city's endless hunger, bound by debts they’ll never escape.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: The Unders—smog, neon, and shadows swallowing architecture.
    "{i}And deeper still—the Unders. Forgotten. Forsaken. Choked by smog and silence.{/i}"
    "{i}A place where light goes to die, and hope burns slower than the air it breathes.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Wide shot of Solveil—towering spires above, decaying labyrinth below.
    "{i}For centuries, the regime known as Echelon has kept its peace alive through illusion—order sustained by relics, their power channeled through sacred Aether Bands.{/i}"
    "{i}Some call them gifts. Others, shackles. But one truth remains: only those born to power are chosen. Only those who obey... survive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Fade to black. A faint ember glows in the dark.
    "{i}Yet not all bloodlines were lost to time.{/i}"
    "{i}And not all truths remain buried forever.{/i}"
