# ACT 1 - Scene 1: Intro
# ===================================================


label act1_intro:

    # VISUAL: Cold white top-light over a pristine skyline above the clouds (Aeries). 
    # The view should feel sterile, geometric, and silent—false perfection.

    "{i}The world ended in ash, and someone built upward to forget it.{/i}"
    "{i}Solveil—order stacked into the sky.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Transition downward through the tiers—Aeries → Middle Levels.
    # AERIES should feel suffocating perfection: symmetry, glass, no wind.

    "{i}At the peak: the Aeries. Glass without dust. Light without warmth.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Middle Levels—dense, industrial, humming with surveillance and motion.

    "{i}Below, the Middle Levels grind—commerce, paperwork, cameras.{/i}"
    "{i}A restless machine, paying for the view above.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Unders—neon haze, dripping water, faint human sounds; light returns from within.
    # Should contrast sharply with the silence of the upper tiers.

    "{i}Deeper still, the Unders. Neon caught in smoke. Footsteps, water, voices.{/i}"
    "{i}Here, light survives by learning to breathe.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Composite wide shot of the entire city—Aeries to Unders, unified vertical frame.
    # The palette should shift from white → steel → blue → amber.

    "{i}Echelon keeps the peace with pageantry and power—relics tamed into Aether Bands.{/i}"
    "{i}Some call them gifts. Others, shackles. Obedience makes the difference.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Fade to black; single ember glows. 
    # Color shift from cold white to faint orange—symbol of hidden humanity.

    "{i}Not everything stayed buried.{/i}"
    "{i}Some truths wait in the glass for someone willing to look.{/i}"

    # canon_note: Keep narration under ~140 words. 
    # Aeries = top-down white light (control); Unders = internal warm light (humanity).
    # Save explicit Verdant/Ethereal bloodline reveal for later scenes.
