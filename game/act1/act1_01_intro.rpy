    # VISUAL: Cold white top-light over a pristine skyline above the clouds (Aeries). 
    # The view should feel sterile, geometric, and silent—false perfection.

    "The world ended in ash, and someone built upward to forget it."
    "Solveil—order stacked into the sky."

    # VISUAL: Transition downward through the tiers—Aeries → Middle Levels.
    # AERIES should feel suffocating perfection: symmetry, glass, no wind.

    "At the peak: the Aeries. Glass without dust. Light without warmth."

    # VISUAL: Middle Levels—dense, industrial, humming with surveillance and motion.

    "Below that: the Middle Levels grind—commerce, paperwork, cameras."
    "A restless machine, paying for the view above."

    # VISUAL: Unders—neon haze, dripping water, faint human sounds; light returns from within.
    # Should contrast sharply with the silence of the upper tiers.

    "And beneath it all: The **Unders**. The forgotten heart. The rotten core."
    "Here, light survives by learning to breathe."

    # VISUAL: Composite wide shot of the entire city—Aeries to Unders, unified vertical frame.
    # The palette should shift from white → steel → blue → amber.

    "Echelon keeps the peace with pageantry and power—relics tamed into Aether Bands."
    "Some call them gifts. Others, shackles. Obedience makes the difference."

    # VISUAL: Fade to black; single ember glows. 
    # Color shift from cold white to faint orange—symbol of hidden humanity.

    "Not everything stayed buried."
    "Some truths wait in the glass for someone willing to look."

    # canon_note: Keep narration under ~140 words. 
    # Aeries = top-down white light (control); Unders = internal warm light (humanity).
    # Save explicit Verdant/Ethereal bloodline reveal for later scenes.
