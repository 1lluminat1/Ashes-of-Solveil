# ACT 2 - Scene 18: Recruitment Wave (Growth Milestone)
# =======================================================


label act2_recruitment_wave:

    # VISUAL: Base. Morning. Week after Noelle scene. Operations room. Busy. Energy different.
    # LIGHTING: Bright. Active. Hopeful.
    # SOUND: Voices. Movement. Life. Growth.

    #scene bg_operations_room_day with fade

    "{i}Morning. Operations room. Busier than usual. More voices. More movement. More... people? When did we get more people? Last count was 20. Feels like more now. Growth. Actual growth. That's new. That's hope.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Selene at command table. Map spread out. Marking locations. Looking satisfied.
    s "Aeron. Lyra. Good timing. We need to talk about our recruitment situation."

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra approaching. Curious. Recruitment situation?
    a "Recruitment situation? What happened?"
    s "Word's spreading. About us. About the resistance. About victories against Echelon. People are coming. Lots of people."

    # VISUAL: She gestures to corner. Five NEW PEOPLE waiting. Nervous. Hopeful. Ready.
    s "These five arrived this morning. Yesterday we had six. Day before, four. We're averaging five new recruits per day. That's 35 new people in the last week."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. 20 became 35 became... 55? In one week?
    a "Fifty-five fighters? We went from twenty to fifty-five in one week?"
    s "And more coming. Purge survivors finding courage. Sector refugees seeking purpose. Even some Echelon deserters hearing about us. The resistance is becoming real. Visible. Dangerous. People want to be part of that."

    # VISUAL: Lyra studying new recruits. Evaluating. Tactical assessment.
    l "That's rapid growth. Too rapid. Security risk. How do we know they're not Echelon plants?"
    s "We don't. Not for certain. That's the problem. Rapid recruitment means rapid vulnerability. We need screening process. Background checks. Verification."

    # VISUAL: Noelle stepping forward. Datapad ready. Already working on solution.
    n "I've developed a screening algorithm. Cross-references personal histories with Echelon databases I've accessed. Identifies inconsistencies, suspicious patterns, probability of infiltration. It's not perfect—87% accuracy—but it significantly reduces risk."

    # VISUAL: Zira also approaching. Street-level intel. Practical verification.
    z "I can run background checks through my contacts. People in the Unders know people. Someone claims they're from Sector 8? I know people in Sector 8. We verify stories. Cross-check details. Liars get caught."

    # VISUAL: Tessa present too. Medical screening as psychological evaluation.
    t "I can interview them. Medical screening covers psychological evaluation. Spot Echelon conditioning patterns. Their soldiers move differently, think differently, respond differently. Training leaves marks. I can see them."

    # VISUAL: Everyone contributing. Team functioning. Problem-solving together.
    s "Good. We use all three. Noelle's algorithm, Zira's contacts, Tessa's evaluation. Triple verification. Anyone who passes all three gets in. Anyone who fails any gets rejected. Harsh but necessary."
    s "Aeron, Lyra—you two handle the interviews. You're both ex-Echelon. You know their tactics, their conditioning, their patterns. You'll spot infiltrators better than anyone."

    # VISUAL: Aeron nodding. Makes sense. Glass instincts useful here.
    a "We can do that. Interview process. Evaluation. Assessment. Filter the real from the fake."
    s "Start with these five. I'll send more as they arrive. We're looking at potentially 100 new recruits by end of month if this pace continues. We need to be thorough. One infiltrator could destroy everything."

    # VISUAL: Approaching the five new recruits. Mix of ages, backgrounds, desperation, hope.
    # RECRUIT 1: Young man, early twenties, Sector 9 survivor, burns on arms (Purge victim)
    # RECRUIT 2: Older woman, forties, former factory worker, lost family in Sweep
    # RECRUIT 3: Middle-aged man, ex-smuggler, knows Zira by reputation
    # RECRUIT 4: Young woman, late teens, orphaned by Echelon, burning rage
    # RECRUIT 5: Man, thirties, FAMILIAR FACE—it's someone from activities if alive (Kren? Repair shop owner?)

    "{i}Five people. Five stories. Five reasons for being here. All hoping we'll accept them. All risking everything by being here. All choosing resistance over survival. That takes courage. Or desperation. Sometimes both.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Setting up interview space. Table. Chairs. Professional but not cold.
    a "We'll interview you one at a time. Questions about your background, your reasons for joining, your skills. Standard process. Be honest. Lies get caught. Honesty gets respected."

    # VISUAL: Recruits nodding. Nervous but determined. First one steps forward.
    # RECRUIT 1: Young man with burns. Sector 9 survivor.

    scene bg_interview_room with fade

    recruit1 "My name is Daven. I'm from Sector 9. Was from Sector 9. Before the Purge."

    # VISUAL: Shows burn scars. Orbital strike survivor. Real trauma. Real scars.
    recruit1 "I was in the market when the strikes hit. Thermal bloom caught me. Third-degree burns on my arms and back. Spent two weeks in underground clinic recovering. Tessa actually treated me. That's how I heard about you."

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra exchanging glance. Tessa connection. Verifiable.
    a "Tessa treated you? She'll remember that. We'll verify. What made you come here?"
    recruit1 "Marcus killed 100,000 people to destroy your resistance. That means your resistance was working. Was dangerous. Was winning. I want to be part of that. Want to make him pay. Want 100,000 deaths to mean something."

    # VISUAL: Raw anger. Real grief. Authentic. Hard to fake this level of trauma.
    l "You have combat experience?"
    recruit1 "None. I was a market vendor. Sold fruit. Never held a gun. But I can learn. I'm strong. I'm motivated. I'll do whatever it takes."

    # VISUAL: Honest. Direct. No pretense. Just determination and grief.
    a "We'll verify your story with Tessa. If it checks out, you're in. We'll train you. Give you purpose. Give you chance to fight back."
    recruit1 "Thank you. I won't let you down. I swear."

    # VISUAL: He leaves. Next recruit enters. Process continuing.
    # RECRUIT 2: Older woman. Former factory worker. Lost family in Sweep.

    recruit2 "My name is Elara. I'm 43. I worked in textile factory in Sector 6 for twenty years. Lost my husband and daughter in the Sweep four years ago."

    # VISUAL: Older. Tired. But determined. Long-burning anger finally finding outlet.
    recruit2 "Your Sweep. Glass Division. Operation 391. My husband was target 247. My daughter was target 248. They died in their apartment. Never even knew why. Never knew what they did wrong."

    # VISUAL: She's looking at Aeron. Knows he's Glass. Knows he was there. Choosing to be here anyway.
    recruit2 "I know who you are. Everyone knows. You're Glass. The one who cracked. The one who gave mercy. The one who defected."
    recruit2 "You killed 390 people that night. Maybe you killed my family. Maybe you didn't. But you stopped. You gave mercy. You chose different. That's more than Marcus ever did. More than Echelon ever did."
    recruit2 "So I'm here. Not to forgive you. Don't think I can do that. But to fight beside you. Because fighting beside you hurts Echelon more than hating you helps anyone."

    # VISUAL: Brutal honesty. She hates what he was. Respects what he's becoming. Complex. Real.
    "{i}She lost family to Glass. To me. Maybe I killed them. Probably I killed them. Targets 247 and 248. I don't remember faces that early. Too many. Too fast. But I killed them. And she's here anyway. Choosing resistance over revenge. That's... that's something.{/i}"

    a "I'm sorry. For your loss. For my part in it. For everything the Sweep took from you. I can't undo it. Can't fix it. Can only try to stop it from happening again."
    recruit2 "Words are cheap. Action matters. You want to make it right? Help me make Echelon pay. That's the only redemption worth anything."
    a "...Yeah. We can do that. Welcome to the resistance."

    # VISUAL: She nods. Leaves. Weight in the room. Heavy. Real. Next recruit enters.
    # RECRUIT 3: Ex-smuggler. Knows Zira. Practical motivations.

    recruit3 "Name's Kael. I'm a smuggler. Was a smuggler. Routes got too hot after Purge. Echelon cracked down. Made business impossible. So I'm here. Figured fighting them beats losing to them."

    # VISUAL: Practical. Mercenary almost. But honest about it.
    a "You're here because business got bad?"
    recruit3 "I'm here because Echelon made business bad. They're squeezing everyone. Unders used to have room to operate. Now? Patrols everywhere. Checkpoints. Raids. Can't move without tripping over Banded soldiers. That's bad for everyone. Resistance included."
    recruit3 "So yeah. I'm here for practical reasons. But practical reasons are still reasons. I fight good. I know routes. I know people. I'm useful. Use me."

    # VISUAL: Lyra evaluating. Mercenary but honest. Useful skill set. Practical addition.
    l "You know Zira?"
    recruit3 "By reputation. She runs the best smuggling network in Lower Spans. I've worked adjacent routes. Never directly with her but I respect her operation. Professional recognizes professional."

    # VISUAL: Aeron noting. Zira will verify. If he's lying about knowing her, he's out.
    a "We'll verify with Zira. If your story checks out, you're in. We can use someone who knows routes and contacts. That's valuable."
    recruit3 "Won't let you down. Practical people don't. We deliver."

    # VISUAL: He leaves. Professional. Efficient. Next recruit enters.
    # RECRUIT 4: Young woman. Late teens. Orphaned. Burning rage.

    recruit4 "I'm Senna. I'm eighteen. Echelon killed my parents three years ago. Killed my brother last year. Killed my uncle two months ago. I'm the last one. And I'm done hiding."

    # VISUAL: Young. Angry. Raw. Reminds Aeron of Lyra when they first met. Same fury. Same determination.
    recruit4 "I know I'm young. I know I look weak. But I'm not. I've survived three years alone. Evaded patrols. Stole food. Fought when I had to. I'm still here. That counts for something."
    recruit4 "I want to fight. Want to kill Banded soldiers. Want to hurt Echelon like they hurt me. Want them to know that they can't just murder families and get away with it. Want revenge."

    # VISUAL: Lyra stepping forward. Sees herself in this girl. Recognition. Concern.
    l "Revenge isn't sustainable motivation. It burns you out. Burns you up. Leaves nothing but ash."
    recruit4 "Then I'll be ash. But I'll be ash that burned Echelon on the way down. That's enough for me."

    # VISUAL: Lyra and Aeron exchanging look. This girl is dangerous. To Echelon. To herself. To everyone.
    a "If we take you, you follow orders. You don't go rogue. You don't take unnecessary risks. Revenge doesn't help if you die stupidly."
    recruit4 "I'll follow orders. As long as orders involve hurting Echelon. That's all I care about."

    # VISUAL: Difficult decision. She's motivated but unstable. Asset or liability?
    "{i}She's a weapon looking for a target. That's useful. That's also dangerous. Weapons don't discriminate. They just destroy. Can we point her at Echelon without her destroying herself? Or us? Maybe. Maybe not. But turning her away sends her somewhere worse. At least here we can watch her. Channel her. Maybe save her from herself.{/i}"

    a "...You're in. But you work with Tessa first. Medical and psychological evaluation. We need to make sure you're stable enough to fight without getting everyone killed."
    recruit4 "I'm stable. I'm focused. I'm ready."
    l "Tessa will determine that. Not you. Accept evaluation or leave. Those are the options."
    recruit4 "(frustrated) ...Fine. I'll talk to Tessa. But then I fight. Deal?"
    a "Deal. Welcome to the resistance."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Bristling with energy. Dangerous energy. Final recruit enters.

    # VISUAL: KREN enters. Familiar. Activity 1 vendor. Survived. Healed. Here.
    kren "Hey. It's me. Kren. Remember? You worked my stall. Earned trust. Saved my supplies."

    # VISUAL: Aeron surprised. Pleased. Kren made it. Survived Echelon. Here now.
    a "Kren! You're alive. You're here. That's... that's good."
    kren "Alive because of you. You helped me when you didn't have to. Kept your promise about supplies. Warned me about raids. That loyalty matters. That's why I'm here."
    kren "I know you're building something. Resistance. Real resistance. I want in. I can move supplies. Know vendors. Know markets. Know people. I'm useful. And I'm loyal. You earned that."

    # VISUAL: Genuine connection. Built through Activity 1. Earned trust paying off.
    a "You don't have to do this. You have your stall. Your business. Your life. Resistance is dangerous."
    kren "Had my stall. Echelon shut me down last week. Suspicious vendor. Associated with defectors. They destroyed everything. Again. So I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain. Let me fight. Let me be useful."

    # VISUAL: Lyra approving. This is loyalty earned. This is trust built. This is resistance growing organically.
    l "He's vouched for. We know him. We trust him. He's in."
    a "Yeah. He's in. Welcome to the resistance, Kren. For real this time."

    repair_owner "Remember me? You helped fix my shop. Repaired the damage. Kept your word. That meant something. Still means something."

    # VISUAL: Aeron recognizing. Activity 3 connection. Earned respect. Paying forward.
    a "I remember. You needed repairs. We helped. You paid. Fair deal."
    repair_owner "More than fair. You didn't have to help. But you did. And then you kept coming back. Checking in. Making sure shop stayed standing. That's loyalty. That's why I'm here."
    repair_owner "I'm too old to fight. But I can build. Can repair. Can maintain equipment. Weapons. Armor. Tech. Whatever you need. I'm useful. Let me help."

    # VISUAL: Practical skills. Valuable. Support role but critical. Resistance needs builders too.
    l "Support roles matter. We need engineers. Repairmen. Builders. You're in."
    a "Welcome aboard. We'll put your skills to use. Trust me on that."

    recruit5 "My name is Tovan. I'm from Sector 11. Heard about resistance through word of mouth. Figured it was time to stop hiding and start fighting. That's why I'm here."

    # VISUAL: Standard recruit. No special connection. Generic but earnest.
    a "What skills do you have?"
    recruit5 "Combat training. Two years in civilian militia before Echelon disbanded us. I know tactics. I know weapons. I know how to follow orders and when to improvise. I'm solid."

    # VISUAL: Lyra evaluating. Competent. Standard. Useful addition. Nothing special but nothing wrong.
    l "We'll verify the militia service. If it checks out, you're in."
    recruit5 "It'll check out. I don't lie about credentials. Too easy to get caught."
    a "Smart. Welcome to the resistance."

    # VISUAL: Interviews complete. Five recruits processed. Some accepted. Some pending verification.
    scene bg_operations_room_day with fade

    "{i}Five interviews done. Five stories. Five reasons. Some personal. Some practical. Some vengeful. Some loyal. All valid. All choosing resistance. All making us stronger. 20 became 35 became 55. Growing. Actually growing. That's power. That's hope. That's dangerous to Echelon.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Returning to Selene. Reporting results. Assessment complete.
    s "How'd it go? Anyone raise red flags?"
    a "Senna—the young woman with revenge motivation—needs psychological evaluation before field work. Unstable but focused. Could be asset or liability. Tessa will determine which."
    a "Everyone else checks out. Stories are verifiable. Motivations are genuine. Skills are useful. They're in."

    # VISUAL: Selene satisfied. Recruitment working. Resistance growing properly.
    s "Good. That's five more. Thirty more waiting outside. This is going to be a long day."
    l "Thirty more? Today?"
    s "Word's spreading fast. We're becoming visible. Becoming real. People want to be part of something that fights back. That's what we're building. That's what we are now."

    # VISUAL: Looking around operations room. More people. More voices. More purpose. Growth tangible.
    "{i}Operations room bustling. People everywhere. Training. Planning. Working. Building. This was twenty people two weeks ago. Now it's fifty-five. By week's end? Eighty? Hundred? Growing faster than we can process. That's good problem to have. That's resistance problem. That's winning problem.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Noelle approaching. Analysis ready. Growth metrics calculated.
    n "Current recruitment rate is 5.2 people per day with 89% retention after screening. Projected growth: 85 fighters by end of week, 140 by end of month. We'll need expanded base capacity. Current infrastructure supports maximum 80. We're exceeding that threshold."

    # VISUAL: Zira also reporting. Practical concerns. Logistics. Supply chains.
    z "Feeding eighty-five people is harder than feeding twenty. We need more supply runs. More contacts. More resources. I can handle it but we need budget increase. Food, water, medical supplies, ammunition—everything scales with numbers."

    # VISUAL: Tessa joining discussion. Medical capacity strained but managing.
    t "Medical station can handle about sixty people comfortably. Above that I need help. An assistant. Maybe two. And more supplies. Lots more supplies. Growing pains are real but they're good pains. Means we're alive. Means we're growing."

    # VISUAL: Everyone contributing solutions. Team handling growth. Resistance adapting. Scaling.
    s "We'll expand. Find secondary location. Split operations. Main base stays here. Secondary base handles overflow. Decentralized structure. Harder for Echelon to destroy everything at once."
    s "Aeron, Lyra—you keep doing interviews. Filter new recruits. Make sure we're growing smart, not just fast. Quality over quantity. But we'll take both if we can get it."

    # VISUAL: Aeron nodding. Understanding weight. Glass isn't just soldier anymore. Glass is leader. Recruiter. Builder. Different role. Important role.
    a "We'll handle it. Keep the quality high. Keep the infiltrators out. Keep the resistance strong."

    # VISUAL: Elara—the woman who lost family to Sweep—approaching. Tentative. Nervous. But determined.
    elara "Aeron. I passed screening. Noelle, Zira, and Tessa all approved me. Does that mean I'm in?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron looking at her. Woman whose family he maybe killed. Choosing to fight beside him anyway. Complex. Heavy. Real.
    a "...Yeah. You're in. Welcome to the resistance."
    elara "Good. I start training tomorrow?"
    a "Tomorrow. We'll teach you everything. How to fight. How to survive. How to hurt Echelon. Everything you need."
    elara "That's all I want. Teach me. I'll learn. I'll fight. I'll make their deaths mean something."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Determined. Strong. Survivor becoming fighter. Glass's victims becoming Glass's allies. Strange redemption. Complicated redemption. But redemption.
    "{i}She lost family to me. Maybe. Probably. And she's here anyway. Fighting beside me. Against common enemy. That's not forgiveness. But it's something. It's choice. It's forward. It's resistance. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's everything.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra touching Aeron's arm. Grounding. Supporting. Understanding.
    l "You okay?"
    a "Yeah. Just... processing. She lost family to Glass. And she's here. Fighting with Glass. That's heavy."
    l "That's progress. She's choosing future over past. That's what we're all doing. That's what resistance is. Moving forward even when past pulls backward."
    a "...Yeah. Forward. Together. That's the only way this works."

    # VISUAL: Operations room. Bustling. Growing. Alive. Resistance becoming real. Becoming dangerous. Becoming hope.
    "{i}Twenty became fifty-five. Next week? Eighty-five. Month? 140. Growing. Scaling. Building. This is what resistance looks like. Not just fighters. But community. People choosing together. People fighting together. People hoping together. That's power Echelon can't buy with Bands. That's power built on choice. On trust. On belief that better future is possible. That's dangerous power. That's winning power. That's us.{/i}"
