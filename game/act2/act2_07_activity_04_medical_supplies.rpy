    # VISUAL: Lower Spans. Day. Sector 7. Hidden alley leading to underground clinic.
    # LIGHTING: Dim natural light filtered through grates above. Warm amber glow from clinic entrance.
    # SOUND: Distant city hum; voices murmuring; someone crying softly; life struggling.

    "{i}Day 4. Activity: Medical Supplies.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said find a medic. Someone who can patch us up when things go wrong.{/i}"
    "{i}Because things will go wrong. They always do.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron following directions. Alley narrows. Graffiti on walls. Signs of life.
    "{i}The address Zira gave me leads here. Sector 7. Deep in the Unders.{/i}"
    "{i}A clinic. Hidden. For people who can't afford Echelon's sanitized medicine.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Entrance marked with faded green symbol. Hand-painted. Medical cross.
    # SOUND: Voices inside. Someone groaning in pain. Someone speaking softly, gently.

    a "{i}Green mark. Medical cross. This is it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Zira said her name is Tessa. Runs a scavenger-care commune.{/i}"
    a "{i}Hybrid medicine. Organic and cybernetic. Whatever keeps people alive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He pushes through hanging cloth serving as door. Enters clinic.
    # LIGHTING: Warm amber-green glow. Bioluminescent plants growing in corners. Soft, alive.
    # SOUND: Quiet. Reverent almost. People resting. Breathing. Healing.

    scene bg_tessas_clinic with fade

    "{i}The clinic smells like herbs and antiseptic mixed together. Life trying to survive.{/i}"
    "{i}Makeshift beds line the walls. Injured people resting. Burns. Wounds. Sickness.{/i}"
    "{i}And in the center, kneeling beside a man with severe burns—her.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa. Mid-20s. Dark hair tied back. Gentle hands glowing faint green.
    # She's applying bioluminescent gel to burn victim. Speaking softly. Calming.
    # LIGHTING: Green glow from her hands. Organic compound. Healing made visible.

    t "(soft, rhythmic) Breathe. That's all I'm asking right now. Just breathe with me."
    t "In through your nose. Hold it. Out through your mouth."
    t "Good. You're doing so well. I know it hurts, but you're here. You're alive."

    # VISUAL: Burn victim (male, 40s) trembling. Tears streaming. But breathing.
    "{i}His skin is charred black in places. Red and weeping in others. Purge victim.{/i}"
    "{i}She works with steady hands. No hesitation. No revulsion. Just care.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands at entrance. Watching. Something in his chest tightens.
    a "{i}She's healing someone I helped create. My mercy triggered the Purge.{/i}"
    a "{i}These burns exist because I saved 200 people. Cascade of consequences.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa looks up. Eyes meet his. Recognition immediate and complete.
    # Her hands don't stop working. Gel continues spreading. Patient comes first.

    $ mark_flag("Tessa", "met")

    t "(quiet, not stopping) You're Glass."

    # VISUAL: Injured man's eyes snap open. Others in clinic turn. Tension spikes instantly.
    # SOUND: Breathing changes. Fear. Anger. Recognition spreading like wildfire.

    "{i}The name echoes in the small space. Glass. Everyone knows Glass.{/i}"
    "{i}Everyone lost someone to Glass. Sector 10. The Sweep. 600 dead.{/i}"

    a "...Yes."

    # VISUAL: Tessa returns focus to patient. Doesn't look at Aeron. Keeps working.
    t "(to patient) It's alright. Stay still. I'm almost finished."
    t "(to Aeron, calm) Why are you here?"

    a "I need medical supplies. Someone said you—"
    t "I know what you need. I asked why you're here."
    t "(still not looking at him) In the Unders. Alive. When Echelon should be hunting you."

    # VISUAL: She finishes applying gel. Bandages the burns carefully. Tender and precise.
    t "(to patient) There. The gel will keep working for the next six hours. You'll feel it cooling."
    t "Rest now. I'll check on you in an hour."

    # VISUAL: Patient nods weakly. Looks at Aeron with mix of fear and hatred. Says nothing.
    # Tessa stands. Turns fully toward Aeron. Studies him. Not with hate. With sadness.

    t "You caused this. The Purge. These injuries. These deaths."
    a "I didn't—"
    t "Your actions triggered it. That's causation enough, even if you didn't light the fires yourself."

    # VISUAL: She walks to sink. Washes hands. Methodical. Centered. Processing.
    "{i}She's calm. Too calm. Like she's decided something already.{/i}"
    "{i}Judgment rendered before I even explained.{/i}"

    a "I'm not asking for forgiveness—"
    t "(turns, looks at him fully) Then what are you asking for?"

    # VISUAL: Long pause. What IS he asking for? Supplies? Absolution? A reason to keep going?
    a "...Help. I need help to keep fighting."
    t "Fighting who? Echelon? Or yourself?"

    # VISUAL: The question lands like a blade. Clean. Precise. True.
    a "{i}Herself? Both? I don't even know anymore.{/i}"

    t "(softer now) Why are you here, Aeron? In the Unders. Away from everything you knew."
    t "You could have stayed in Aeries. Stayed Glass. Stayed safe."
    t "But you didn't. Why?"

    a "Because I watched 100,000 people die and I couldn't be part of that system anymore."
    a "Because I'm trying to fix what I broke. Even if I can't. Even if it kills me."

    $ adjust_empathy_once("act2_med_tessa_confession", +1)

    # VISUAL: She studies him. Eyes deep and warm and infinitely sad. Measuring truth.
    t "You can't fix 100,000 dead, Aeron. You can't patch souls with medicine."
    t "But you can help the living. If that's truly what you want."

    # VISUAL: She moves to cabinet. Opens it. Pulls out medkit. Well-stocked. Organized.
    # Places it on table between them. Offering. Testing.

    t "I'm Tessa Kael. I heal people. All people. Even those who don't deserve it."
    t "(looks at him directly) Which means you too. Despite everything."

    a "Why?"
    t "Because mercy isn't about deserving. It's about choosing."
    t "And I choose to believe you're here for the right reasons."
    t "(slight pause) Prove me right. Or prove me a fool. Either way, I'll have tried."

    # VISUAL: She pushes medkit toward him. Not freely given. Offered with expectation.
    a "{i}She's not forgiving me. She's giving me a chance.{/i}"
    a "{i}Burden of proof. Earn it through action.{/i}"

    a "I don't know if I deserve this chance."
    t "Probably not. But that's not for me to judge."
    t "I heal. You fight. We both serve life in different ways."
    t "(gentle but firm) Take the medkit. Use it to save someone. Then come back."
    t "Show me Glass can do more than cut."

    # VISUAL: He takes medkit. Heavy. Not just weight. Responsibility. Expectation.
    a "Thank you."
    t "Don't thank me yet. Gratitude means nothing until you've earned it."
    t "Actions first. Words after."

    # VISUAL: He turns to leave. Stops. Looks back at burn victim. At others resting.
    a "These people. The burn victims. They're from the Purge?"
    t "Most of them, yes. Survivors from Sectors 8, 9, and 10."
    t "The ones who made it out. Barely."

    a "How many?"
    t "In my clinic right now? Fourteen. In all of Sector 7? Maybe a hundred."
    t "(quiet) Out of 100,000. That's the survival rate."

    # VISUAL: Numbers crushing him. 100,000 dead. 100 survived. Because of his mercy.
    a "{i}My mercy killed 99,900 people.{/i}"
    a "{i}The arithmetic of guilt. It never balances.{/i}"

    a "How did you—"
    t "I see it in your face. The weight. The math."
    t "(steps closer) Stop counting the dead, Aeron. Start counting the living."
    t "You can't bring back 100,000. But you can save the next hundred."
    t "That's how you fix it. One person at a time. Forever."

    # VISUAL: She says it simply. Like it's obvious. Like redemption is just arithmetic.
    a "That's... a long time."
    t "Yes. It is."
    t "(small sad smile) But you're here. Which means you're willing to try."
    t "That's more than most people manage."

    # VISUAL: Someone calls from across clinic. Another patient needs attention.
    voice "Tessa? I need help over here."

    t "Coming!"
    t "(to Aeron) I have to go. People need me."
    t "(hands him second medkit) Take this too. You'll need more than one."
    t "And Aeron? Come back when you've used them. I want to know who you saved."

    a "You want me to report back?"
    t "I want you to remember their names. The people you save."
    t "(firm) Because Glass killed 600 people. I want to know how many Aeron saves."
