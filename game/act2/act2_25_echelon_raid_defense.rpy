# =======================================================


label act2_echelon_raid_defense:

    # VISUAL: Base. Morning. Two days after Tessa's mercy death. Nine days left on countdown. Alarm blaring.
    # LIGHTING: Red emergency lights. Flashing. Urgent. War has arrived.
    # SOUND: ALARM. LOUD. Continuous. People mobilizing. Running. Preparing. War starting.

    scene bg_base_alarm with fade

    "ALARM. Loud. Urgent. Persistent. This is it. This isn't drill. This isn't preparation. This is real. Echelon found us. Nine days into fourteen day countdown. Noelle's 73% became 100%. They're here. They're coming. War has arrived. Ready or not. Here it comes."

    # VISUAL: NOELLE at command station. Data streaming. Multiple screens. Tracking. Analyzing. Coordinating.

    n "(over comms, urgent but controlled) Echelon task force detected. Six blocks north. Converging on our position. Estimated strength: 40-50 Banded soldiers. Specialized assault configuration. ETA: eight minutes. This is not drill. This is confirmed hostile contact. All personnel to defensive positions. Repeat: This is confirmed hostile contact."

    # VISUAL: BASE erupting. People moving. Grabbing weapons. Taking positions. Training becoming reality. 587 fighters mobilizing. Organized chaos. Controlled panic. War beginning.

    "Base erupting. 587 people moving simultaneously. Some to defensive positions. Some to evacuation routes. Some to weapons. Some to medical. Everyone moving. Everyone functioning. Training taking over. Muscle memory replacing thought. That's good. That's what keeps people alive. Training. Discipline. Muscle memory. Don't think. Just move. Just function. Just survive."

    # VISUAL: SELENE at command table. Map displayed. Tactical overview. Enemy approach vectors marked. Defensive positions assigned. Commander mode fully engaged.

    selene "(over comms) All squad leaders confirm positions. North perimeter: Defensive line established? East perimeter: Escape routes secured? Medical: Triage stations ready? Communications: Maintain coordination. Move! MOVE!"

    # VISUAL: AERON running to command. Lyra beside him. Both armed. Both ready. Both terrified. But functioning. That's all that matters.

    a "Selene. Status?"
    selene "Forty to fifty hostiles. Banded. Specialized assault units. This isn't patrol stumbling onto us. This is targeted strike. They knew where we were. They planned this. They're coming to destroy us like they destroyed Sector 10. This is Purge 2.0. Smaller scale. Same intent."

    # VISUAL: Lyra processing tactical data. Military mind working. Calculating. Strategizing. Finding advantage.

    l "Forty to fifty against our 587? We have numbers. But they're trained. Enhanced. Assault configured. We're mostly new recruits. Training incomplete. Combat inexperienced. Numbers advantage negated by skill and enhancement disparity. This is bad tactical scenario."

    # VISUAL: Noelle pulling up more data. Predictive analysis. Battle simulation. Probability calculations. Cold truth.

    n "Simulation shows 47% probability of successful defense with current positioning. 38% probability of catastrophic casualties exceeding 200 fighters. 15% probability of complete base destruction requiring full evacuation. Optimal strategy: Staged defense with prepared fallback positions. Hold long enough to inflict casualties. Retreat before overwhelming. Survive to fight another day."

    # VISUAL: Selene nodding. Accepting reality. Can't win decisively. Can survive. That's enough. That's the goal.

    selene "Staged defense it is. We hold north perimeter. Inflict maximum casualties. When they breach—and they will breach—we fall back to secondary positions. Keep fighting. Keep bleeding them. When secondary falls, we evacuate through east tunnels. Disperse. Regroup at secondary bases. We don't win this. We survive this. Clear?"

    # VISUAL: Command team nodding. Aeron. Lyra. Noelle. Understanding. Accepting. Fear visible. But determination stronger.

    a "Clear. Hold. Bleed them. Retreat. Survive. Simple. Doable. We can do this."
    selene "We have to. Because alternative is 587 casualties. Alternative is everyone dying. Alternative is Purge completing what it started. Not acceptable. We survive. Whatever it costs. We survive."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA entering. Been outside. Scouting. Intel fresh. Ground truth confirming Noelle's data.

    z "Confirmed visual on assault force. Fifty-two soldiers. Heavy weapons. Breaching equipment. They're not scouting. They're not raiding. They're assaulting. Full military operation. Professional. Coordinated. Deadly. ETA now six minutes. We need to move."

    # VISUAL: Final preparations. Commands issued. Positions taken. War imminent. Everyone moving to roles. Character synergy beginning.

    selene "Noelle. Command station. Coordinate everything. You're our eyes. Our brain. Our connection. Keep everyone informed. Keep everyone alive."
    selene "Zira. You're on sabotage. Slow them down. Confuse them. Make them bleed before they reach perimeter. Whatever you can do. Do it."
    selene "Lyra. North perimeter defense. You're field commander. Organize squads. Direct fire. Hold the line. You're military. Show them why."
    selene "Tessa. Medical. Triage. Casualties are coming. Lots of casualties. Save who you can. That's your job. That's everything."
    selene "Aeron. You're with me. Command coordination. We direct overall defense. We make real-time decisions. We keep this from becoming massacre. That's us. That's now."

    # VISUAL: Everyone dispersing. Moving to positions. Roles assigned. Synergy beginning. Team functioning. War starting.

    "Everyone moving. Everyone functioning. Everyone scared. Everyone doing it anyway. That's courage. That's resistance. That's us. Noelle coordinating. Zira sabotaging. Lyra defending. Tessa healing. Selene commanding. Aeron supporting. All of us. Together. Functioning. Surviving. Fighting. That's everything. That's all we have. That's enough."

Making enemies bleed before engagement. She's done this before. Solo operations. Guerrilla tactics. This is familiar. This is comfortable. This is her."

    # VISUAL: Zira planting explosive charges. Streetside. Building support. Entryways. Tactical placements. Creating killzone. Creating delay. Creating cost.

    z "(over comms, calm) Charges set on approach route. Building facades. Support columns. Street barriers. When they pass through, I detonate. Won't stop them. Will slow them. Will cost them. Will make them cautious. That's advantage. That's time. That's what you need."

    # VISUAL: Echelon force entering killzone. Fifty-two soldiers. Professional. Confident. Unaware. Walking into trap.

    "They're here. Fifty-two soldiers. Banded. Enhanced. Armed. Confident. They think they're hunting. They think they're overwhelming. They think they're winning. They don't know Zira's watching. Don't know charges are set. Don't know they're walking into prepared killzone. That ignorance? That costs. That costs everything."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA detonating. Multiple explosions. Street erupting. Buildings collapsing. Dust. Chaos. Confusion. Enemy scattered.

    # SOUND: EXPLOSIONS. LOUD. Multiple. Overlapping. Destruction. Chaos. War announcing itself.

    "EXPLOSIONS. Buildings collapsing. Street erupting. Dust everywhere. Can't see. Can't hear. Just chaos. Just destruction. Just Zira's welcome to our territory. She made them bleed. Made them cautious. Made them slow. That's advantage. That's time. That's Zira. Perfect."

    # VISUAL: Dust clearing. Casualties visible. Five Echelon soldiers down. Dead or wounded. Forty-seven remain. Slowed. Cautious. Angry. But still coming.

    z "(over comms) Five confirmed casualties. Forty-seven hostiles remaining. They're slowed. They're angry. They're cautious. You have three minutes to final preparation. Make them count. I'm falling back to secondary sabotage points. Will hit them again if opportunity presents. Zira out."

    # VISUAL: Zira disappearing. Shadows. Alleys. Ghost mode. She's doing her part. Now others do theirs.

    "Zira gone. Five enemies down. Forty-seven remain. Three minutes until contact. She did her job. Made them bleed. Made them slow. Made them angry. Now we do ours. We hold. We fight. We survive. Three minutes. That's all we have. That's enough. Has to be enough."

And she knows it. Can see it in her posture. In her voice. In her command. She's found her role. She's owning it. That's Lyra. That's leader. That's us."

    # VISUAL: Lyra organizing squads. Positioning fighters. Directing fire lanes. Establishing fallback routes. Professional. Efficient. Military perfection.

    l "(commanding) First squad: North wall. Second squad: East flank. Third squad: Support position rear. Hold fire until they're in range. Controlled bursts. Aim for center mass. Make every shot count. We have ammo advantage. We have position advantage. We use both. We hold this line. Clear?"

    # VISUAL: Fighters responding. Discipline visible. Training working. Confidence building. Lyra effect. Leadership effect.

    fighters "Clear!"

    l "Good. When I give fallback order—and I will give fallback order—you move fast. You move together. You cover each other. You get to secondary positions. No heroes. No last stands. We're not dying here. We're fighting here. Then retreating. Then surviving. That's the plan. That's everything. Remember it."

    # VISUAL: Enemy approaching. Visible now. Forty-seven soldiers. Banded. Enhanced. Armed. Advancing carefully. Professional. Dangerous. Real.

    "They're here. Forty-seven remaining. Can see them. Moving carefully. Zira's explosions taught them caution. They're advancing with discipline. With coordination. With enhancement. They're professionals. They're dangerous. They're everything we feared. And they're here. And we're fighting. Now. This is it. This is war. This is real."

    # VISUAL: Lyra raising hand. Waiting. Calculating range. Timing. Perfect timing. Then... signal.

    l "FIRE!"

    # VISUAL: FIFTY FIGHTERS opening fire simultaneously. Concentrated fire. Coordinated. Devastating. Enemy taking hits. Surprised. Bloodied. But still advancing.

    # SOUND: GUNFIRE. Overwhelming. Continuous. Wall of sound. Wall of death. War at full volume.

    "GUNFIRE. Fifty weapons firing. Continuous. Coordinated. Enemy taking hits. Five down. Seven down. Ten down. We're doing damage. We're effective. We're fighting. But they're still coming. Still advancing. Still dangerous. Bands keeping them moving. Enhancement keeping them fighting. They're bleeding but they're not breaking. Not yet. Not easily."

    l "(over comms, urgent) Taking casualties! Eight fighters down! North perimeter holding but we're bleeding! Need support! Need advantage! Need something!"

    # VISUAL: Fighters scared. Some breaking. Some retreating early. Discipline fracturing. Reality of combat overwhelming training. This is real. This is death. This is terrifying.

    "Fighters breaking. Some retreating. Some panicking. This isn't training. This is real combat. Real bullets. Real death. Real terror. Training only goes so far. Reality breaks everyone eventually. They're breaking. Lyra's trying to hold them. But they're breaking. We're losing cohesion. Losing discipline. Losing fight. This is bad. This is disaster forming."

    # VISUAL: Lyra in center. Exposed. Commanding. Visible. Rallying. Refusing to break. Refusing to let them break.

    l "(shouting) HOLD! HOLD THE LINE! You break now, everyone dies! You hold now, we survive! HOLD! For each other! For resistance! For everyone behind us! HOLD!"

    # VISUAL: Her words working. Fighters steadying. Discipline returning. Not because orders. Because Lyra. Because belief. Because leadership. She's holding them together through will alone. That's leadership. That's Lyra. That's everything.

    "She's holding them. Through voice. Through presence. Through refusing to break herself. They see her standing. See her fighting. See her not breaking. And they don't break either. They hold. They fight. They believe. Because she believes. That's leadership. That's what Lyra brings. That's what makes her invaluable. Not tactics. Not training. Belief. She makes them believe. That's everything."

    # NOELLE - COORDINATION HUB
    # ==============================================================

Tessa, casualty surge incoming, prepare for twelve wounded. Selene, ammunition consumption rate exceeds projections, resupply needed north perimeter in four minutes. Processing. Coordinating. Optimizing."

    # VISUAL: Everyone responding to her coordination. Moving. Adapting. Functioning. She's making them effective. Making them survive. Making them work.

    "She's conducting symphony. Battle symphony. Every fighter is instrument. She's conductor. Making them harmonize. Making them function. Making them survive. Without her? Individuals fighting alone. With her? Army fighting together. That's difference between survival and massacre. That's Noelle. That's invaluable. That's love working through data. That's perfect."

    # VISUAL: Enemy adapting. Changing tactics. Flanking. Pressuring. Professional response to organized defense. They're good. Coordinated. Dangerous. This is hard fight.

    n "(analyzing) Enemy tactical adaptation detected. They're coordinating assault on three vectors simultaneously. Attempting to overwhelm single point defense. Probability of north perimeter breach increased to 78%. Recommend staged fallback in 90 seconds. Lyra, prepare retreat order. Selene, confirm?"

    # VISUAL: Selene at command. Seeing same data. Understanding. Accepting. Ordering retreat. Survival over victory.

    selene "(over comms) Confirmed. Lyra, prepare fallback. Ninety seconds then you move. Controlled retreat. Get everyone to secondary positions. You've bled them enough. Time to survive. Move on my mark."

    # TESSA - MEDICAL TRIAGE
    # ==============================================================

Adding names to both sides of board. Living and dead. Counting all of them. Witnessing all of them. Honoring all of them. This is war. This is cost. This is Tessa's hell. And she's functioning. She's saving. She's continuing. That's strength. That's courage. That's her."

    t "(to assistant) Pressure here. Stop the bleeding. I need to access the wound. Stay with me. Stay focused. We save this one. We can save this one. Pressure! MORE pressure!"

    # VISUAL: Fighter stabilizing. Bleeding slowing. Breathing steadying. Saved. One more name for living side. One more success. One more proof she matters.

    t "(moving to next patient) This one's stable. Tag green. Move them to recovery. Next patient! NEXT!"

    # VISUAL: Next patient. Worse. Much worse. Abdominal wound. Internal bleeding. No equipment. No time. No hope. Dying. Looking at Tessa. Seeking miracle. Finding reality.

    "Next patient. Dying. Obviously dying. Internal bleeding. Can't stop it. Can't fix it. Don't have equipment. Don't have time. Don't have anything except mercy. Again. Second time. Two days after Torin. Another impossible choice. Another mercy death. Another name for dead side. Another weight for forever. This is war. This is cost. This is what she prepared for. And she does it. She delivers mercy. Again. Because that's what healers do in war. They save who they can. They mercy who they can't. They count everyone. They continue. That's Tessa. That's strength. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: Tessa moving to dying fighter. Gentle. Compassionate. Honest. Professional despite breaking inside.

    t "(quiet, to dying fighter) I'm sorry. I can't save you. You're bleeding internally. I don't have what I need. I can make you comfortable. I can make it peaceful. I can stay with you. But I can't save you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

    # VISUAL: Fighter understanding. Accepting. Grateful for honesty. For presence. For mercy. For dignity.

    "Retreat. Controlled. Covered. Professional. They're doing it. Falling back without breaking. Without panicking. Without becoming massacre. That's training. That's Lyra. That's success. We're losing ground but we're not losing people. Not all of them. Some. But not all. That's victory in retreat. That's survival. That's enough."

    # VISUAL: Enemy pursuing. Pressing advantage. But cautious. Zira's sabotage taught them. Resistance effectiveness taught them. They're winning but they're bleeding. They're advancing but they're dying. Cost mounting for them too. That's important. That's what matters. We make them bleed. We make them pay. We make them remember. This isn't Purge. This isn't massacre. This is fight. This is war. This is resistance. And resistance bites back.

Seventy-five total casualties. That's 13% casualty rate. That's acceptable in defensive action. That's success. But we can't sustain. We hold this position five more minutes. Then we evacuate. Then we disperse. Then we survive. Five minutes. That's all we have left."

    "Evacuating. Everyone moving. Wounded carried. Equipment grabbed. Base abandoned. We're leaving. We're surviving. We're dispersing. Echelon takes the base. But we take ourselves. We take our people. We take our resistance. That's what matters. Buildings are replaceable. People aren't. We save the people. We survive. That's victory. That's enough. That's everything."

Tomorrow we prepare. Tomorrow we fight again. That's cycle. That's war. That's what we chose. And we choose it again. And again. And again. Until victory or death. That's us. That's resistance. That's Phoenix. Rising from every fire. Burning brighter every time. That's enough. That's everything. That's perfect."
