label act2_echelon_raid_defense:

    # VISUAL: Base. Morning. Two days after Tessa's mercy death. Nine days left on countdown. Alarm blaring.
    # LIGHTING: Red emergency lights. Flashing. Urgent. War has arrived.
    # SOUND: ALARM. LOUD. Continuous. People mobilizing. Running. Preparing. War starting.

    scene bg_base_alarm with fade

    "{i}ALARM. Loud. Urgent. Persistent. This is it. This isn't drill. This isn't preparation. This is real. Echelon found us. Nine days into fourteen day countdown. Noelle's 73% became 100%. They're here. They're coming. War has arrived. Ready or not. Here it comes.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: NOELLE at command station. Data streaming. Multiple screens. Tracking. Analyzing. Coordinating.

    n "(over comms, urgent but controlled) Echelon task force detected. Six blocks north. Converging on our position. Estimated strength: 40-50 Banded soldiers. Specialized assault configuration. ETA: eight minutes. This is not drill. This is confirmed hostile contact. All personnel to defensive positions. Repeat: This is confirmed hostile contact."

    # VISUAL: BASE erupting. People moving. Grabbing weapons. Taking positions. Training becoming reality. 587 fighters mobilizing. Organized chaos. Controlled panic. War beginning.

    "{i}Base erupting. 587 people moving simultaneously. Some to defensive positions. Some to evacuation routes. Some to weapons. Some to medical. Everyone moving. Everyone functioning. Training taking over. Muscle memory replacing thought. That's good. That's what keeps people alive. Training. Discipline. Muscle memory. Don't think. Just move. Just function. Just survive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: SELENE at command table. Map displayed. Tactical overview. Enemy approach vectors marked. Defensive positions assigned. Commander mode fully engaged.

    # VISUAL: AERON running to command. Lyra beside him. Both armed. Both ready. Both terrified. But functioning. That's all that matters.

    a "Selene. Status?"
    selene "Forty to fifty hostiles. Banded. Specialized assault units. This isn't patrol stumbling onto us. This is targeted strike. They knew where we were. They planned this. They're coming to destroy us like they destroyed Sector 10. This is Purge 2.0. Smaller scale. Same intent."

    # VISUAL: Lyra processing tactical data. Military mind working. Calculating. Strategizing. Finding advantage.

    l "Forty to fifty against our 587? We have numbers. But they're trained. Enhanced. Assault configured. We're mostly new recruits. Training incomplete. Combat inexperienced. Numbers advantage negated by skill and enhancement disparity. This is bad tactical scenario."

    # VISUAL: Noelle pulling up more data. Predictive analysis. Battle simulation. Probability calculations. Cold truth.

    n "Simulation shows 47% probability of successful defense with current positioning. 38% probability of catastrophic casualties exceeding 200 fighters. 15% probability of complete base destruction requiring full evacuation. Optimal strategy: Staged defense with prepared fallback positions. Hold long enough to inflict casualties. Retreat before overwhelming. Survive to fight another day."

    # VISUAL: Selene nodding. Accepting reality. Can't win decisively. Can survive. That's enough. That's the goal.

    selene "Staged defense it is. We hold north perimeter. Inflict maximum casualties. When they breach—and they will breach—we fall back to secondary positions. Keep fighting. Keep bleeding them. When secondary falls, we evacuate through east tunnels. Disperse. Regroup at secondary bases. We don't win this. We survive this. Clear?"

    # VISUAL: Command team nodding. Aeron. Lyra. Noelle. Understanding. Accepting. Fear visible. But determination stronger.

    a "Clear. Hold. Bleed them. Retreat. Survive. Simple. Doable. We can do this."
    selene "We have to. Because alternative is 587 casualties. Alternative is everyone dying. Alternative is Purge completing what it started. Not acceptable. We survive. Whatever it costs. We survive."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA entering. Been outside. Scouting. Intel fresh. Ground truth confirming Noelle's data.

    z "Confirmed visual on assault force. Fifty-two soldiers. Heavy weapons. Breaching equipment. They're not scouting. They're not raiding. They're assaulting. Full military operation. Professional. Coordinated. Deadly. ETA now six minutes. We need to move."

    # VISUAL: Final preparations. Commands issued. Positions taken. War imminent. Everyone moving to roles. Character synergy beginning.

    selene "Noelle. Command station. Coordinate everything. You're our eyes. Our brain. Our connection. Keep everyone informed. Keep everyone alive."
    selene "Zira. You're on sabotage. Slow them down. Confuse them. Make them bleed before they reach perimeter. Whatever you can do. Do it."
    selene "Lyra. North perimeter defense. You're field commander. Organize squads. Direct fire. Hold the line. You're military. Show them why."
    selene "Tessa. Medical. Triage. Casualties are coming. Lots of casualties. Save who you can. That's your job. That's everything."
    selene "Aeron. You're with me. Command coordination. We direct overall defense. We make real-time decisions. We keep this from becoming massacre. That's us. That's now."

Tessa healing. Selene commanding. Aeron supporting. All of us. Together. Functioning. Surviving. Fighting. That's everything. That's all we have. That's enough.{/i}"

Don't know charges are set. Don't know they're walking into prepared killzone. That ignorance? That costs. That costs everything.{/i}"

    z "(over comms) Five confirmed casualties. Forty-seven hostiles remaining. They're slowed. They're angry. They're cautious. You have three minutes to final preparation. Make them count. I'm falling back to secondary sabotage points. Will hit them again if opportunity presents. Zira out."

    # VISUAL: Zira disappearing. Shadows. Alleys. Ghost mode. She's doing her part. Now others do theirs.

    "{i}Zira gone. Five enemies down. Forty-seven remain. Three minutes until contact. She did her job. Made them bleed. Made them slow. Made them angry. Now we do ours. We hold. We fight. We survive. Three minutes. That's all we have. That's enough. Has to be enough.{/i}"

    l "Good. When I give fallback order—and I will give fallback order—you move fast. You move together. You cover each other. You get to secondary positions. No heroes. No last stands. We're not dying here. We're fighting here. Then retreating. Then surviving. That's the plan. That's everything. Remember it."

Reality breaks everyone eventually. They're breaking. Lyra's trying to hold them. But they're breaking. We're losing cohesion. Losing discipline. Losing fight. This is bad. This is disaster forming.{/i}"

    "{i}We survived. Forty died. But we survived. 547 fighters alive. Wounded. Exhausted. Traumatized. But alive. But fighting. But resisting. That's victory. That's proof we can do this. Can fight Echelon. Can survive their assaults. Can continue despite cost. That's everything. That's hope. That's resistance. That's us. And we continue. Tomorrow we rebuild. Tomorrow we grow. Tomorrow we prepare. Tomorrow we fight again. That's cycle. That's war. That's what we chose. And we choose it again. And again. And again. Until victory or death. That's us. That's resistance. That's Phoenix. Rising from every fire. Burning brighter every time. That's enough. That's everything. That's perfect.{/i}"
