# ACT 2 - Activity 3: Gather Intel (Meet Noelle)
# =======================================================


label activity_gather_intel:

    # VISUAL: Lower Spans. Night. Sector 6 rooftops overlooking Echelon patrol routes.
    # LIGHTING: Cold blue-white from streetlights below; neon glow distant; shadows deep.
    # SOUND: City hum; distant patrols; Aeron's breathing; wind through metal.

    "{i}Day 3. Activity: Gather Intel.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said know your enemy, so I'm learning.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron crouched on rooftop edge. Binoculars (if acquired) or just eyes.
    # Watching Echelon patrols below. Taking notes on old datapad.

    "{i}Echelon patrols move like clockwork—predictable, every 20 minutes, same routes.{/i}"
    "{i}Or they were. Something's changed.{/i}"

    a "{i}The patrol patterns are shifting. Not random though. There's logic here—deliberate adaptation.{/i}"
    a "{i}They're responding to resistance activity somehow.{/i}"
    a "{i}But how? What's the underlying pattern?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He reviews notes. Frustrated. Data incomplete. Can't see the bigger picture.
    "{i}Three nights of tracking and I still can't predict them.{/i}"
    "{i}There's an algorithm here somewhere. I'm just not seeing it.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Footstep. Soft. Behind him. Close.
    # VISUAL: He tenses. Hand moves toward weapon (if acquired).

    "{i}Not alone.{/i}"

    # He spins. Ready. Tense.
    # VISUAL: Figure stands 3 meters away. Female. Mid-20s. Arms crossed. Unimpressed.

    n "You're reading that wrong."

    # VISUAL: Noelle. Silver-blue eyes. Clinical posture. No threat display, just observation.
    # LIGHTING: Cold blue glow from datapad illuminates her face. Sharp. Precise.

    a "Who—"

    n "The patrol shifts aren't random—they're algorithmic. Echelon uses predictive modeling to adapt their routes based on resistance activity patterns."
    n "You're tracking outcomes, the physical movement patterns, but you're missing the inputs that feed their decision matrices."
    n "That's why you can't predict them."

    # VISUAL: She steps closer. Not threatening. Just... analyzing. Like he's data.
    "{i}She moves like she's solving an equation, every step calculated and deliberate.{/i}"

    a "(hand still on weapon) How long have you been watching me?"
    n "Three nights, same as you've been watching them."
    n "You're consistent and methodical, but your analysis has fundamental gaps."

    a "And you're an expert?"
    n "Yes."

    # VISUAL: No hesitation. No arrogance. Just fact. She believes it completely.
    a "{i}No bravado, no performance. She states it like math.{/i}"
    a "{i}Two plus two equals four. She's an expert. Same certainty.{/i}"

    a "Why tell me? Why not just keep doing your own thing?"
    n "Because I need field data—real-time observations from someone who knows what they're looking at."
    n "I can model algorithms, predict shifts, and map probabilities, but I need ground-truth verification to refine my accuracy."
    n "You provide field observations, I provide predictive analysis. Both parties benefit from the exchange."

    # VISUAL: She extends hand. Not friendly. Transactional. Like a business deal.
    n "Noelle Korr. I used to work for Compliance Division as a neural conditioning researcher."
    n "Until I discovered they were rewriting people's memories to maintain social obedience."
    n "I objected to the ethical violations. They objected to my objection. Mutual termination of our relationship."
    n "(matter-of-fact) Now I'm here, underground, and very interested in Echelon's predictive models."

    # VISUAL: He hesitates. Compliance Division. Echelon. But she said 'used to.'
    a "(carefully) You worked for Echelon?"
    n "Past tense matters. I left when I discovered what they were really doing."
    n "They're not just maintaining order—they're erasing cognitive dissent at the neurological level."
    n "I had evidence. They wanted me silent. I declined and escaped with my research data."

    # VISUAL: He takes her hand. Firm. Brief. Professional.
    a "Kade Voss. Observer, currently gathering intel on patrol movements."
    n "'Kade Voss' is an alias, but that's acceptable. I don't require real names for functional partnerships."
    n "Your actual identity is irrelevant as long as your data is accurate."

    # VISUAL: She releases hand. Pulls out her own datapad. More advanced. Covered in notes.
    n "Show me your data and I'll correct your analysis."

    # VISUAL: He hesitates. Sharing intel = risk. But she's right. He needs help.
    a "{i}She's blunt, clinical, no social performance whatsoever.{/i}"
    a "{i}Either completely genuine or the best actor I've ever encountered.{/i}"
    a "{i}But she's right—I'm missing something. And I need answers.{/i}"

    # He shows her datapad. She scans it. Eyes moving rapidly. Processing.
    # VISUAL: Her face: focused, analytical, slight frown (data displeases her).

    n "(scrolling quickly) This is incomplete—surface-level observations with no temporal cross-referencing."
    n "You're tracking current patterns but not historical trends or predictive modeling."
    n "Echelon adapts every 72 hours based on resistance activity metrics. You've captured one cycle, which is insufficient for meaningful prediction."

    a "(defensive) I've been tracking for three nights—"
    n "Right, three nights equals one cycle. You need minimum three cycles—nine nights of continuous observation—before the underlying patterns become statistically visible."
    n "Single-cycle data is essentially noise without context."

    # VISUAL: She pulls up her own data. Screen filled with charts, graphs, models.
    n "I've been tracking for six weeks with historical data, predictive algorithms, and pattern analysis."
    n "Their current patrol model is what I'm calling Adaptive Response Protocol 7."
    n "It shifts every 68 to 76 hours depending on local resistance incidents and sector-specific threat assessments."
    n "(points to map) Next shift happens in approximately 22 hours. Routes will change here, here, and here."

    # VISUAL: She points to specific locations. Precise. Confident.
    a "{i}She's not guessing. She knows this. But how?{/i}"

    a "How can you be sure?"
    n "Bayesian probability combined with historical precedent and pattern recognition. I've modeled their decision-making algorithm across 47 shift cycles."
    n "Current confidence interval is about 89% with a margin of error around plus or minus 4%."
    n "(slight shrug) If you want absolute certainty, you're asking the wrong person. Certainty is irrational in complex systems."
    n "But high probability within acceptable error margins? That I can provide."

    # VISUAL: He stares at her data. Complex. Beyond his training. But... logical.
    a "You really know your stuff."
    n "Yes, that's what I said initially. Are you experiencing comprehension delay or just processing the implications?"

    # VISUAL: Pause. He realizes: she's not being rude. She's literal. No social filter.
    a "{i}She doesn't do sarcasm or hints. Just direct truth.{/i}"
    a "{i}It's almost refreshing after years of performance and masks.{/i}"

    a "No, just not used to people being this direct."
    n "Indirect communication is inefficient and introduces unnecessary ambiguity. I prefer clarity even when clarity creates social discomfort."
    n "Most people find it off-putting, but it reduces misunderstandings by approximately 60%."

    # VISUAL: She closes her datapad. Looks at him fully. Analyzing.
    n "You're military trained—Echelon methodology specifically. I can tell from your observation technique and postural habits."
    n "But you're here gathering intel against them, which creates an obvious contradiction."
    n "(direct eye contact) So which is it? Defector or active infiltrator?"

    # VISUAL: He tenses. This is the moment. Lie or truth?

        "Tell the truth (partial)—'Defector. Very recently.'":

            a "Defector. Very recently—less than a week."
            n "(processing) Temporal context suggests defection during the Purge event. Causal relationship?"
            a "Yes. I witnessed it and couldn't stay after that."
            
            n "(nods slowly) That's a logical response to severe cognitive dissonance."
            n "You experienced ethical conflict when your actions contradicted your core values. The system rejected your humanity, or your humanity rejected the system."
            n "Either framing leads to the same outcome—defection becomes psychologically necessary."
            
            a "You're not concerned that I was Echelon?"
            n "Past tense is critical here. 'Was' versus 'is' changes the entire probability matrix."
            n "Your current behavior patterns suggest genuine defection rather than active infiltration. Observable data supports your claim."
            n "(tilts head) Probability you're deceiving me? Approximately 23%. That's within my acceptable risk threshold for potential partnerships."
            
            # VISUAL: She extends datapad toward him. Offering collaboration.
            n "I'll share my predictive models if you share field observations. Together we achieve more accurate predictions and higher survival probability."
            n "Does that sound reasonable?"

        "Deflect—'Does it matter? I'm here now working against them.'":
            $ noelle_trust = 0
            $ aeron_honest_with_noelle = False
            
            a "Does it matter? I'm here now, actively working against Echelon."
            n "(pause) Evasive response. You're declining to provide relevant contextual data."
            n "That indicates either classified information constraints or trust issues, both of which are understandable but complicate partnership dynamics."
            
            a "I'm not trying to complicate things—"
            n "Then provide context. Or don't—but understand that I calculate risk continuously."
            n "Unknown variables increase uncertainty. Uncertainty decreases my willingness to share high-value intelligence."
            
            # VISUAL: She doesn't seem hurt. Just... calculating. Adjusting probability.
            n "I'll share limited data—surface-level analysis only until you prove reliable."
            n "If you demonstrate consistent accuracy and non-hostile intent, I'll increase information sharing accordingly."
            n "Basic trust protocol. Does that work for you?"

    # VISUAL: Either way, she extends datapad. Offering some level of partnership.
    a "Acceptable. And... thank you."
    n "Gratitude is unnecessary for transactional exchanges, but acknowledged anyway. You're welcome."

    # VISUAL: She transfers data to his datapad. Files flowing. Advanced intel.
    # SOUND: Electronic beeps. Data transfer. His pad suddenly much more useful.

    "{i}Her data fills my datapad—charts, models, predictions, analysis.{/i}"
    "{i}More intelligence than I could gather in months. She's sharing it in seconds.{/i}"

    a "This is extensive. You're sure you want to share all this?"
    n "Information hoarded is information wasted. Resistance requires distributed knowledge and redundant data storage."
    n "Also, if you die with this data, I have backups in three separate locations. Risk mitigation."

    # VISUAL: He can't tell if she's joking. Her face: completely neutral.
    a "Right. Risk mitigation."
    n "Was that intended as humor? I detected possible sarcasm but remain uncertain."
    a "Honestly, I don't know either."
    n "Acceptable answer. Ambiguity acknowledged. Moving forward."

    # VISUAL: She moves to rooftop edge. Looks down at patrols. Observing.
    n "Next patrol arrives in approximately 4 minutes. Route designation Alpha-7. Confidence level: 94%."
    n "We'll observe together, verify my model's accuracy, and I'll adjust variables if the prediction fails."

    # VISUAL: They stand side by side. Watching. Waiting. Silence comfortable (for her).
    "{i}She doesn't fill silence with unnecessary words. Doesn't perform socially. Just exists.{/i}"
    "{i}Watching data transform into reality. Equations becoming patrols.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Patrol approaches below. Boots. Voices. Echelon soldiers.
    # VISUAL: Exactly on schedule. Exactly the route she predicted.

    n "Route Alpha-7, exactly as predicted. Model accuracy confirmed."
    n "(small note of satisfaction) Good. I really dislike being wrong."

    a "You do this every night? Predict their movements?"
    n "Daily, yes. Predictive modeling has a calming effect on me—there's something deeply satisfying about finding order within apparent chaos."
    n "It's also functionally useful for survival since avoiding Echelon requires knowing where they'll be before they arrive."

    a "How long have you been down here living underground?"
    n "Six months, three weeks, and two days since I left Compliance Division."
    n "My survival rate has exceeded initial projections, which suggests successful environmental adaptation."
    n "(slight pause) Though I do miss reliable data infrastructure and climate-controlled environments."

    # VISUAL: She says it matter-of-fact. Missing climate control = missing family.
    a "{i}She misses climate control, not people or comfort. Climate control.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can't tell if that's sad or just... her. Just how her mind works.{/i}"

    a "Do you work with others or primarily solo?"
    n "Primarily solo. Social interaction requires significant energy that I prefer allocating toward research and analysis."
    n "But I maintain a small network of contacts—information sources, occasional collaborators. People I can work with on specific projects."
    n "(gestures between them) This qualifies as one. Mutually beneficial and surprisingly tolerable so far."

    a "Tolerable. That's high praise."
    n "(brief glance at him) You haven't annoyed me yet, which is statistically rare. Most people become irritating within the first ten minutes."
    n "You're currently at 15 minutes with minimal irritation. That's promising."

    # VISUAL: They watch patrols disappear. Silence returns. She prepares to leave.
    n "I have sufficient observational data for tonight. I'm returning to run full analysis on the variables."
    n "(transfers coordinates to his pad) Meet me here tomorrow at 23:00. Different location, same purpose. Try not to be late."

    a "What if I can't make it?"
    n "Then I work alone as usual, which I'm accustomed to."
    n "(slight pause) But I'd prefer you attend. Your field observations improve my predictive accuracy by 12 to 18 percent, which is statistically significant enough to justify continued collaboration."

    # VISUAL: She turns to leave. Stops. Looks back. Almost uncertain (rare for her).
    n "Kade. One question before I go."
    a "Yeah?"
    n "Why defect specifically? What was the variable that shifted you from compliance to resistance?"

    # VISUAL: He processes. How to explain the Purge? The guilt? The shattering?
    a "I watched 100,000 people die in minutes because of decisions I made."
    a "And I realized I couldn't be part of that system anymore."

    n "(long pause, processing carefully) Causal guilt combined with ethical crisis. Your entire identity structure fractured when your actions contradicted your core values."
    n "(quieter, more careful) That's... logical. Extremely painful, but logically consistent."
    n "I'm sorry for what you're experiencing. Even though logically, expressing regret doesn't change past events or reduce your pain."

    # VISUAL: She says it awkwardly. Like practicing a skill she's studied but not mastered.
    a "Thank you. I think."
    n "I'm not particularly skilled at emotional responses. They don't come naturally to me."
    n "But the research data suggests empathy improves cooperative relationships, so I'm attempting it."
    n "(slight uncertainty) Was that adequate?"

    a "(small smile) You're doing fine."
    n "(nods once) Noted. I'll continue making attempts then."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Disappears into shadows. Gone as suddenly as she appeared.
    "{i}And just like that she's gone, like she was never here at all.{/i}"
    "{i}But my datapad is full of her work—models, predictions, brilliant analysis.{/i}"

    a "{i}Noelle Korr. Analyst. Former Compliance Division researcher.{/i}"
    a "{i}Blunt, clinical, brilliant, and unexpectedly human beneath all that logic.{/i}"
    a "{i}And somehow I think I just made an ally.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He reviews her data. Page after page. Intricate. Beautiful in its logic.
    a "{i}She sees the world in patterns, algorithms, probabilities.{/i}"
    a "{i}No performance, no masks, no social games. Just unfiltered truth.{/i}"
    a "{i}It's strange and uncomfortable, but there's something honest about it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe that's what I need right now. Someone who can't lie even if she wanted to.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Return to safe house. Report to Zira. Activity complete.
    scene bg_safe_house with fade

    # VISUAL: Zira examining the data Noelle provided. Impressed.
    z "Where the hell did you get this? This is professional-grade intelligence analysis."
    a "Met someone tonight. An analyst who's been tracking Echelon independently."
    z "She? What's her name?"
    a "Noelle Korr. Says she used to work for Compliance Division."

    # VISUAL: Zira stops. Looks up sharp. Recognizes the name immediately.
    z "(low whistle) Noelle Korr. I've heard of her."
    z "Neural conditioning researcher. Absolutely brilliant. She disappeared from Echelon about six months ago."
    z "Word is she stole massive amounts of classified research data. They've been hunting her ever since."

    a "She mentioned discovering ethical violations. Memory alteration programs."
    z "Yeah. She found proof that Echelon was literally rewriting people's memories to maintain compliance."
    z "Erasing dissent at the neurological level. She tried to expose it internally, and they tried to erase her."
    z "(grins) But she got out with her research intact. And now she's working with you."

    a "Is that a problem?"
    z "Problem? Glass, you just partnered with one of the most wanted defectors in Solveil."
    z "(looks at data again) This is incredibly valuable. Keep working with her."
    z "She's probably the smartest person in this entire city, and if she's willing to share intel with you, don't fuck it up."

    a "She wants to meet again tomorrow night. Same arrangement."
    z "Go. Learn everything she'll teach you. This kind of predictive analysis could save dozens of lives."
    z "(serious now) But be careful. She's Echelon's second-most-wanted target after you."
    z "If they find you together, they'll kill both of you without hesitation."

    a "Understood."
    z "Good. Now get some rest. Tomorrow's another day of not dying, and apparently you have a date with a genius."
