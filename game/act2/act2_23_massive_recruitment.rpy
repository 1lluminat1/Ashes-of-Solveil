# ACT 2 - Scene 23: Massive Recruitment Success (Growth Milestone)
# =======================================================


label act2_massive_recruitment:

    # VISUAL: Base. Morning. Two weeks after Noelle scene. Operations room. Crowded. Very crowded.
    # LIGHTING: Bright. Active. Busy. Energy high. Hope tangible. But shadows lurking.
    # SOUND: Voices everywhere. Movement. Organization. Controlled chaos. Growth. Success. Too much success?

    scene bg_operations_room_crowded with fade

    "Operations room. Crowded. Really crowded. When did we get this many people? Last count was 55. Two weeks ago. Now? Can't even count them all. Everywhere. Training. Planning. Working. Moving. This isn't squad anymore. This isn't even platoon. This is company. This is army. This is visible."

    # VISUAL: Selene at command table. Maps spread. Markers everywhere. Tracking growth. Managing expansion. Looking satisfied but... strained. Worried?

    "Selene looks exhausted. Good exhausted. Success exhausted. But there's something else. Tension in shoulders. Worry in eyes. She's managing something big. Something that's growing faster than expected. That's good problem. That's winning problem. But it's also exposure problem. Visibility problem. Target problem."

    # VISUAL: Aeron approaching. Navigating through crowd. People everywhere. Some recognize him. Some don't. Too many new faces. Too many unknowns.

    a "Selene. Report says we have new arrivals? How many this time?"

    # VISUAL: Selene looking up. Tired but pleased. Success visible despite exhaustion. But concern underneath.

    s "Thirty-seven. Yesterday. Twenty-nine the day before. Forty-two the day before that. We're averaging 35 new recruits per day. Have been for two weeks. That's nearly 500 new people in fourteen days."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. 55 plus 500 equals... that's exponential. That's too fast. That's visible.

    a "Five hundred in two weeks? We went from 55 to... what? 550?"
    s "575 as of this morning. Eight more arrived while we were talking. And there's a group of twelve waiting outside. Heard about us from Sector 11. That's 587 if they all pass screening."

    # VISUAL: Looking around operations room. Too many people. Base at capacity. Beyond capacity. Overflow visible. Success overwhelming.

    s "We're at maximum capacity. Past maximum capacity. Current base infrastructure supports maybe 80 people comfortably. We have 575. That's seven times over. We're sleeping in shifts. Eating in shifts. Training in shifts. Everything in shifts because we don't have space for everyone simultaneously."
    s "We need distributed infrastructure. Multiple bases. We need it yesterday. But establishing bases takes time. And time is something we're running out of."

    # VISUAL: Noelle approaching. Datapad in hand. Analysis ready. Numbers calculated. But expression troubled. Data shows problem.

    n "Current growth trajectory is unsustainable with single-base model. Projected numbers: 650 fighters by end of week, 800 by end of month. That's pre-Purge strength achieved in four months total. Three times faster than original resistance buildup."

    # VISUAL: She's all business. Professional. But glances at Aeron. Private moment. Then back to data. Back to problem.

    n "I've identified four potential secondary locations. Abandoned structures suitable for base operations. Distributed across Sectors 7, 9, 11, and 13. Optimal strategy for scale we're achieving."
    n "However, there's a complication. Actually, multiple complications."

    # VISUAL: She pulls up different display. Heat map. Echelon patrol patterns. Density increasing. Encroaching. Searching.

    n "Echelon patrol density has increased 47% over the past two weeks. Correlated directly with our recruitment surge. They don't know where we are yet, but they know something is happening. Someone is organizing. Someone is growing. They're searching. Systematically. Methodically. Getting closer."

    # VISUAL: Map showing patrol patterns. Tightening net. Closing in. Time running out.

    n "I've run probability models. Current trajectory shows 73% chance of base discovery within two weeks. 89% within three weeks. 98% within month. We're growing too fast to stay hidden. Success is making us visible. Visibility is making us vulnerable."

    # VISUAL: Room quieter now. Success euphoria dampened. Reality setting in. Growth has cost. Visibility is danger.

    "Noelle's data. Cold. Clinical. Honest. 73% discovery in two weeks. 89% in three. We're winning by growing. But growing makes us target. Success makes us visible. And visible means Echelon finds us. Finds all 575 of us. That's problem. That's danger. That's cost of winning."

    # VISUAL: Zira joining discussion. Street-level intel confirms Noelle's data. Ground truth matches analysis.

    z "My contacts say Echelon's mobilizing. Big mobilization. Not normal patrol increases. Task force level. They're calling us 'The Phoenix.' Because we rose from the Purge's ashes. Because we're rebuilding what Marcus thought he destroyed."
    z "That's powerful branding. That's hope people can see and touch and join. But it's also target. It's threat Marcus can't ignore. He destroyed us once with orbital strikes. He'll try again. And this time he knows we're coming. He'll be ready."

    # VISUAL: Tessa also present. Medical perspective. Humanitarian concerns. People-focused. But realistic.

    t "I'm treating 60-70 people per day. Minor injuries mostly. But that changes when Echelon finds us. When raids come. When fighting starts. Then I'm treating combat casualties. Critical wounds. Dying people. 575 fighters means potentially 575 casualties. That's 575 names I might lose. That's 575 people I have to try to save. I'm not ready for that. Not at this scale."

    # VISUAL: Lyra standing with Aeron. Tactical assessment. Military perspective. Combat reality.

    l "575 fighters. Maybe 200 are combat-ready. Rest need training. Need weeks or months to be effective. We have numbers but not readiness. We're big but we're not strong. Not yet. If Echelon hits us now? We're target-rich environment with insufficient defense. We're vulnerable."

    # VISUAL: Everyone contributing. Problems identified. Success revealing weakness. Growth showing vulnerability. Reality check.

    "Everyone talking. But tone different now. Not celebration. Concern. We built this. From 12 to 575. That's success. That's hope. That's army. But it's also target. It's also vulnerability. It's also time running out before Echelon finds us. Before everything we built becomes everything we lose."

    # VISUAL: Selene raising hand. Quiet. Attention. Decision time. Leadership showing through concern.

    s "Alright. Here's reality. We're 575 strong. That's battalion strength. That's legitimate military force. That's what we wanted. What we needed. What we fought for."
    s "But Noelle's right. We're visible now. Too visible. Echelon is searching. They will find us. Not if. When. We have maybe two weeks. Maybe three. Maybe month if we're lucky. Then they come. And when they come, they'll come hard."

    # VISUAL: Looking around table. At core team. At people who built this. Reality acknowledged. Plans adjusted.

    s "So we have two parallel missions. Mission one: Keep growing. Keep recruiting. Keep training. Get to 800. Get to combat ready. Get to strong enough that when Echelon finds us, we can fight back. That's offense. That's hope."
    s "Mission two: Prepare for discovery. Prepare for raid. Prepare for fight. Establish secondary bases. Distribute forces. Decentralize command. Make sure when Echelon hits us, they can't destroy everything at once. That's defense. That's survival."

    # VISUAL: Map spread. Four new locations marked. Sectors 7, 9, 11, 13. Strategic distribution. Coverage expansion. Survival strategy.

    s "We split into five cells. Main base here stays command center. Four secondary bases handle overflow and regional operations. Each base gets commander. Distributed leadership. Decentralized structure."
    s "When Echelon hits one base, others survive. When one cell is compromised, others continue. We're not 847 in one location anymore. We're 575 in five locations. Harder to destroy. Harder to eliminate. Harder to Purge."

    # VISUAL: Assignments coming. Natural distribution of skills. But weight visible. This is preparation for war.

    s "We need commanders for the secondary bases. Capable leaders who can operate independently. People who've proven themselves. People who understand what we're building."
    
    # VISUAL: Looking around room. At recruits who've risen. At people who've shown leadership. Not core team. Others.
    
    s "Daven. The Sector 9 survivor with burns. You've been training recruits for two weeks. You're patient. You're dedicated. You understand what people need. Sector 7 base is yours. 120 fighters. Focus on community integration and civilian support. You're good with people. Use that."
    
    # VISUAL: Daven stepping forward. Surprised. Honored. Accepting responsibility. Growth visible.
    
    daven "I... yes. I can do that. I will do that. Thank you for trusting me. I won't let you down."
    
    s "Vex. The info broker. You know routes. You know contacts. You know how to move resources quietly. Sector 9 base is yours. 150 fighters. Focus on supply operations and logistics. Keep them equipped. Keep them supplied. Keep them operational."
    
    # VISUAL: Vex nodding. Professional. Practical. This is his expertise. He's ready.
    
    vex "I can do that. Supply chains are my specialty. Information networks become supply networks. They won't go hungry. Won't go unarmed. I'll handle it."
    
    s "Commander Theron. Ex-military. Pre-Echelon era. You understand structure. You understand discipline. You understand combat. Sector 11 base is yours. 130 fighters. Focus on tactical training and combat readiness. Make them soldiers. Make them effective. Make them survive."
    
    # VISUAL: Theron - the veteran from interviews. Older. Experienced. Accepting command with military bearing.
    
    theron "Understood. I'll make them ready. Discipline. Training. Structure. They'll be combat effective. You have my word."
    
    s "Commander Risa. You've been with us since the 55-fighter mark. You've seen us grow. You've proven yourself in operations. You're smart. You're capable. You're ready. Sector 13 base is yours. 100 fighters. Focus on reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Eyes and ears. Information warfare. Keep us informed."
    
    # VISUAL: Risa - newer character, but capable. Smart. Observant. Ready for responsibility.
    
    risa "I'm ready. Sector 13 is mine. We'll be your eyes. Your information network. You'll know what Echelon's doing before they do. I promise."
    
    # VISUAL: Four commanders appointed. Capable people. Not main crew. Shows resistance has depth. Has capability beyond core team.
    
    s "Good. You four are now base commanders. You operate independently but coordinate with central command. You're responsible for your fighters. For their training. Their safety. Their lives. That's weight. That's burden. That's leadership. You carry it now."
    
    # VISUAL: Four new commanders accepting responsibility. Growth visible. Resistance scaling beyond just main characters.
    
    "Four commanders. Daven. Kael. Theron. Risa. People who stepped up. People who proved themselves. People who can lead without us holding their hands. That's growth. That's resistance becoming real. Becoming organization. Becoming army with structure beyond just core team. That's success. That's what we built. That's proof we're not just personalities. We're movement. We're system. We're real."
    
    # VISUAL: Selene turning to core team. Different assignments. Keeping them together. Central command.
    
    s "Aeron, Lyra. You stay here. Main base. Central command. You're too valuable to fragment. You train commanders. You coordinate operations. You provide strategic oversight. That's your role now. Leadership development. Command coordination. Strategic planning."
    
    s "Noelle. Main base. Central intelligence. Data analysis. Echelon tracking. You're our early warning system. Our predictive analysis. Our strategic advantage. You stay central. You stay connected. You keep us informed."
    
    s "Zira. You're still running external operations. Intelligence gathering. Street-level intel. But you base here. You coordinate from here. You're our connection to the Unders. To contacts. To information networks. That's central. That's here."
    
    s "Tessa. You set up medical stations at each base. Train staff. Distribute supplies. But your primary station is here. Main base. Central medical. When casualties come—and they will—they come here. You're here. That's where you're most needed."
    
    # VISUAL: Core team staying together. Main base. Central command. Not fragmented. Not scattered. Together.
    
    "Core team stays together. Main base. Central command. We're not splitting up. We're not fragmenting. We're building organization around us. Building structure. Building capability. But we stay together. That's important. That's what keeps us strong. Not just tactical. Emotional. We're family. We function together. We fight together. We stay together. That's us."

    # VISUAL: Team accepting assignments. Responsibility growing. But understanding weight. This isn't just organization. This is preparation for war. For loss. For sacrifice.

    "Assignments given. Structure established. We're distributing because we're preparing to be hit. We're decentralizing because we're preparing to lose locations. We're training because we're preparing to fight. This isn't celebration. This is preparation. This is knowing Echelon is coming. And preparing anyway. That's resistance. That's us."

    # VISUAL: Selene's expression. Determined but heavy. She knows cost coming. She's seen it before. Purge taught her. Won't let it happen again without fight.

    s "We're not 12 people hiding anymore. We're 575 fighters organizing for war. We're becoming what we were before the Purge. But we're doing it with Echelon watching. With timer running. With target on our backs."
    s "That's dangerous. That's risky. That's possibly stupid. But it's necessary. We can't stay small and hidden forever. We have to grow. Have to become threat. Have to become army that can actually fight Echelon."
    s "So we grow knowing we're being hunted. We build knowing we might lose it. We fight knowing we might die. But we do it anyway. Because hiding forever isn't living. It's just slower dying. We choose to fight. We choose to risk. We choose to be visible. That's resistance. That's us."

    # VISUAL: New recruit entering. Nervous. Young. Hopeful. One of the twelve from outside. Unaware of danger. Just seeing hope.

    recruit_young "Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. We're the group from Sector 11. Twelve of us. We heard about The Phoenix. About resistance that's actually resisting. Can we join?"

    # VISUAL: Selene looking at young recruit. Seeing hope. Seeing potential. Seeing future casualty. Seeing person who might die because they chose to resist. But accepting them anyway.

    s "You can. Welcome to the resistance. Aeron will interview you. Standard screening. But understand what you're joining. We're growing. We're strong. We're hope. But we're also target. Echelon is hunting us. They will find us. When they do, there will be fighting. There will be casualties. You might die. That's reality. That's cost. You still want in?"

    # VISUAL: Young recruit processing. Fear showing. But determination stronger. Choice made. Hope chosen despite danger.

    recruit_young "Yes. I still want in. My family died in the Purge. Hiding didn't save them. Compliance didn't save them. Nothing saved them. So I'd rather die fighting than die hiding. At least fighting means something. At least fighting is choice. I'm in."

    # VISUAL: Selene nodding. Respect. Understanding. Accepting sacrifice offered. Heavy burden. Leadership weight.

    s "Then you're in. Welcome to The Phoenix. Welcome to the fight. Welcome to everything that comes with it. Good and bad. Hope and danger. Life and death. Welcome."

    # VISUAL: Young recruit leaving to join others. Twelve more. 587 total. More tomorrow. More next week. Growth continuing. Target growing. Timer counting down.

    "Twelve more. 587 total. Tomorrow? 595. Next week? 650. End of month? 800. We're rebuilding to pre-Purge strength. But every number is person. Every person is potential casualty. Every recruit is name that might go on Tessa's wall of the dead instead of wall of the living. That's cost of growth. That's price of hope. That's weight we carry."

    # VISUAL: Operations room. Still crowded. Still overwhelming. But energy different now. Not just celebration. Preparation. Awareness. Cost acknowledged.

    # TRANSITION: Moving to interview area. The twelve waiting. Hopeful. Nervous. Unaware of full danger. But choosing anyway.

    scene bg_interview_area with fade

    "Interview area. The twelve from Sector 11. Ranging from teens to middle-aged. Mix of backgrounds. All desperate. All hopeful. All choosing resistance. All accepting risk without knowing full cost. That's courage. That's choice. That's what makes army from nothing. People choosing to fight. Even when fighting means dying."

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra conducting interviews. Process refined. Efficient. But heavier now. Each acceptance is person who might die.

    # QUICK MONTAGE: Multiple interviews. Different stories. Same theme. Echelon hurt them. Resistance offers hope. They choose risk.

    # INTERVIEW 1: Teen, orphaned by Purge, nowhere else to go
    recruit_teen "Echelon killed my family in the Purge. I've been alone for three months. Heard about The Phoenix. Figured dying fighting is better than dying alone. At least here I matter."

    # INTERVIEW 2: Middle-aged woman, factory worker, lost job to automation
    recruit_woman "They automated my factory. 200 workers replaced by machines. We're starving. Dying slowly. Might as well die quickly fighting. Might as well make them pay."

    # INTERVIEW 3: Young man, former Echelon supporter, disillusioned by Purge
    recruit_man "I believed in Echelon. Thought they brought order. Then I saw the Purge. 100,000 dead. That's not order. That's murder. I can't support that. I fight against it now."

    # INTERVIEW 4: Older man, ex-military, pre-Echelon era, wants to fight like it meant something
    recruit_veteran "I'm old. I'm tired. But I remember when fighting meant protecting people. Not oppressing them. I want to fight like that again. One more time. Before I die. And I will die. But at least it'll mean something."

    # VISUAL: Story after story. Pain after pain. Hope after hope. All choosing resistance. All accepting risk. All approved. All added to count. All potential casualties.

    "Twelve interviews. Twelve approvals. Twelve people who chose to fight knowing death is possible. That's 587 now. Tomorrow more. Next week more. Each one person. Each one name. Each one potential loss. But also each one hope. Each one choice. Each one proof resistance matters. That's worth risk. That's worth danger. That's worth everything."

    # VISUAL: Interviews complete. All twelve accepted. Directed to orientation. To training. To becoming fighters. To becoming casualties or victors. Time will tell.

    a "Welcome to the resistance. All of you. You made hard choice. Brave choice. Right choice. We'll train you. We'll equip you. We'll support you. We'll make you dangerous."
    a "But understand. We're being hunted. Echelon is searching for us. They will find us. When they do, there will be fighting. Some of you will die. That's reality. That's war. That's cost. But you'll die fighting for something that matters. For freedom. For choice. For future worth having. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: The twelve nodding. Sober now. Understanding weight. But accepting it. Choosing it. Ready. They're part of something now. Something dangerous. Something worth dying for.

    # TRANSITION: Back to operations room. Command meeting. Planning next phase. But mood different. Celebration dampened by reality. Success shadowed by danger.

    scene bg_operations_room_command with fade

    # VISUAL: Core team gathered. Selene, Aeron, Lyra, Noelle, Zira, Tessa. Planning. Organizing. Preparing. But weight visible. Cost acknowledged.

    s "587 confirmed fighters. We're establishing four secondary bases this week. Distributed leadership. Decentralized structure. That's preparation. That's survival strategy."

    # VISUAL: Map spread. Four new locations. But also Echelon patrol patterns overlaid. Danger zones marked. Search areas highlighted. Net closing.

    s "But understand what we're really doing. We're not just organizing. We're preparing to be hit. We're preparing to lose people. We're preparing for war that's coming whether we're ready or not."

    # VISUAL: Noelle adding data. Timeline. Probabilities. Cold truth. Numbers don't lie.

    n "Current projections: 650 fighters by week end. 800 by month end. That's pre-Purge strength. But Echelon discovery probability increases with every recruit. We're in race. Can we get strong enough before they find us? Unknown. Probability favors discovery before full readiness. We're likely to fight at 600-700 strength. Not 800. Not optimal. But reality."

    # VISUAL: Zira providing street perspective. Danger assessment. Echelon mobilization real.

    z "Echelon's mobilizing task force. Not normal patrols. Specialized units. They're serious. They know we're becoming threat. They'll hit us hard when they find us. Overwhelming force. Like Purge but targeted. We need to be ready. Need to be strong. Need to be able to survive what's coming."

    # VISUAL: Tessa adding humanitarian perspective. Medical reality. Casualties projected.

    t "When Echelon hits us, I'll be treating mass casualties. Combat wounds. Critical injuries. Dying people. 587 fighters means potentially 587 patients. I'm preparing. Training staff. Stockpiling supplies. Setting up triage protocols. But people will die. I can't save everyone. That's reality. That's cost. That's weight I carry."

    # VISUAL: Lyra providing military assessment. Combat readiness. Tactical truth.

    l "587 fighters. Maybe 200 are combat-ready. Rest need more training. We're growing fast but training takes time. If Echelon hits us in two weeks? We fight with what we have. Not optimal. Not ideal. But we fight anyway. We survive. We adapt. We win. That's the plan."

    # VISUAL: Selene listening. Absorbing. Deciding. Leader carrying weight of 587 lives. 587 potential casualties. 587 names.

    s "So we have two weeks to two months before Echelon finds us. And we're at maybe 35% combat readiness. That's tight. That's dangerous. That's possibly disaster waiting to happen."
    s "But we continue. We train. We prepare. We grow. And when they find us? We're 600 fighters. Maybe 700. Maybe 800 if we're lucky. And we fight. And some of us die. And some of us survive. And we continue. Because that's resistance. That's war. That's us."

    # VISUAL: Team nodding. Agreement. Determination. Understanding stakes. Accepting cost. Moving forward despite danger.

    "Two weeks to two months until Echelon finds us. 35% combat readiness. Growth racing against discovery. Training racing against raid. Hope racing against fear. We're winning by metrics. But winning makes us target. And target means casualties. That's cost of resistance. That's price of hope. That's weight we accepted when we chose to fight instead of hide."

    # VISUAL: Standing together. Core team. Built this. From twelve to 587. From hiding to threatening. From nothing to army. But also from safety to danger. From invisibility to target. From low risk to high casualties. Together. Choosing anyway.

    s "You all did this. Built this. Recruited. Trained. Organized. Led. Believed. Made people believe. Made hope real. Made resistance dangerous. That's victory. That's success. That's everything we wanted."
    s "But success has cost. Visibility has danger. Growth has risk. 587 people are counting on us. Trusting us. Following us. They might die because they followed us. That's weight. That's burden. That's leadership. We carry that. Together."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. From Glass to resistance fighter to commander. Journey visible. Weight tangible. Cost real.

    a "From 12 people in temp shelter. To 587 in command structure. Three months. That's hope made real. That's proof we can build something. Can resist. Can matter."
    a "But Noelle's data is right. We're visible. We're target. Echelon is coming. When they come, people will die. People I recruited. People I trained. People I convinced to fight. Their deaths are on me. That's cost. That's weight. That's price of leadership."

    # VISUAL: Collective moment. Team. Family. Resistance. Army. Burden. All of it. Together. Heavy. Real. Accepted.

    "Standing with the core team—Selene, Lyra, Noelle, Zira, Tessa. We built this from nothing into something that matters. But every new recruit is another potential name for Tessa’s wall. Hope isn’t free. Every choice we make buys it with blood. And we’ll keep paying, because submission is just slower dying. We chose to fight. We chose meaning over safety. That’s resistance. That’s us."

    # VISUAL: Operations room. Crowded. Overwhelming. Beautiful. Dangerous. 587 people choosing resistance. Choosing hope. Choosing risk. That's everything. That's army. That's target. That's us.

    # VISUAL: Noelle at her station. Pulling up one final display. Echelon patrol convergence projection. Visual representation of danger. Timer counting down.

    n "Final data point for consideration. Echelon patrol convergence patterns suggest they're narrowing search area. Multiple sectors eliminated. Search focused on remaining possibilities. Our sectors included."
    n "(softly) Projection: discovery probability seventy-three percent within fourteen days..."
    "She hesitates, eyes flicking from the screen to us—like she’s not just reading data anymore, but seeing faces behind the numbers."
    n "...That’s two weeks. Two weeks until everything changes. Until theory becomes reality. Until we learn if we built an army—or a grave."

    # VISUAL: Room silent. Weight settling. Reality acknowledged. Timer counting. Fourteen days. Maybe less. Maybe more. But coming. Definitely coming.

    s "Then we have fourteen days. Fourteen days to train. To prepare. To get ready. To become strong enough that when they find us, we fight back. We survive. We win. That's the mission. That's the goal. That's everything."
    s "Fourteen days. Make them count. Make every hour count. Make every recruit count. Make everything matter. Because in fourteen days, Echelon comes. And when they come, we're ready. We're strong. We're 600 fighters who aren't running. Who aren't hiding. Who are standing. Who are fighting. Who are winning. That's us. That's resistance. That's Phoenix rising from ash to burn everything that tried to destroy us."

    # VISUAL: Team dispersing. Missions assigned. Preparations beginning. Clock ticking. Fourteen days. Timer started. War approaching.

    "Fourteen days. Maybe less. Maybe more. But coming. Echelon is coming. 587 fighters preparing. Training. Hoping. Risking. Choosing to fight despite knowing cost. That's army. That's resistance. That's us. Built from nothing. Grew too fast. Became visible. Became target. Became danger. And now we wait. We prepare. We hope. And we count down. Fourteen days until everything we built is tested. Until hope meets reality. Until resistance becomes war. Fourteen days. That's all we have. That's everything we need. That's enough. Has to be enough. Because alternative is submission. And we chose to fight. No matter cost. No matter danger. No matter casualties. We chose. That's resistance. That's us. That's Phoenix. Rising. Burning. Fighting. Winning or dying. But fighting. Always fighting. That's enough. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: Team dispersing. Selene remains for a moment. Watching recruits. Thinking. Heavy silence.
    "The others leave. Only Selene and I remain. The room still hums with energy, but underneath it—fear. She’s staring at the map, the patrol patterns, the converging lines of red light."

    s "(quietly) I’ve seen this pattern before. Different year, same shape. Before the Purge."
    a "You think it’s happening again."
    s "Not yet. But it will. They can’t allow something like us to exist twice."
    a "Then we make sure it’s not the same ending."
    s "(meeting his eyes) Then don’t die before the sequel, Commander."
    "She says it with half a smile, but her eyes say something else entirely—memory, fear, resolve. The kind that only people who’ve already survived the end of the world can have."

    # canon_note: Scene 23 complete - massive recruitment with quiet unease
    # canon_note: Growth: 55 → 587 in two weeks (532 new recruits, exponential)
    # canon_note: "The Phoenix" - street name spreading, hope visible, but also target
    # canon_note: Noelle's data: 73% discovery probability in 14 days, 89% in 3 weeks
    # canon_note: Echelon mobilizing task force - not patrols, specialized units hunting them
    # canon_note: Distributed command structure - 4 secondary bases as survival strategy
    # canon_note: Combat readiness: only 35% (~200/587) ready, rest need training
    # canon_note: Timeline: 14 days until likely discovery, not enough time for full readiness
    # canon_note: Tone shift: celebration dampened by reality, success shadowed by danger
    # canon_note: Cost acknowledged: every recruit is potential casualty, growth = visibility = target
    # canon_note: Selene's warning: "We're preparing to be hit, preparing to lose people"
    # canon_note: Weight of leadership: 587 lives depending on them, potential 587 casualties
    # canon_note: Theme: Hope has cost, visibility has danger, growth attracts predators
    # canon_note: Foreshadowing: Scene 24 (casualties), Scene 25 (the raid they're preparing for)
    # canon_note: Timer started: 14 days countdown to Echelon discovery and raid
