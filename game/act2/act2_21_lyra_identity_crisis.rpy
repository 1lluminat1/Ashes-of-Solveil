# ACT 2 - Scene 21: Lyra - Identity Crisis (Relationship Depth)
# =======================================================


label act2_lyra_identity_crisis:

    # VISUAL: Base. Late afternoon. Training yard. Lyra overseeing squad drills. Performing well. Professional.
    # LIGHTING: Natural light. Clear. Bright. Contrasts with inner darkness coming.
    # SOUND: Training. Orders. Movement. Normal operations. Surface normal.

    #scene bg_training_yard with fade

    "{i}Training yard. Lyra running drills. Squad of new recruits learning formations. Tactical movements. Combat basics. She's good at this. Patient. Clear. Effective instructor. Natural leader. People listen to her. Follow her orders. Respect her skill. She's valuable here. Important. But does she see that? Or does she only see what she's not?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Watching from distance. Lyra commanding squad. Confident. Competent. Then... hesitation. Hand to wrist. Checking Band. Again. Third time in five minutes.

    "{i}She's checking the Band. Again. That's the fourth time this training session. Fifth? Losing count. She does this more now. More frequently. More compulsively. Touching it. Verifying it's working. Making sure it's still there. Still functional. Still keeping her... what? Human? Valuable? Alive? What does she think the Band does?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Training concludes. Squad dismissed. Well done. Effective session. But Lyra looks exhausted. Drained beyond physical exertion.

    recruit_new "Thank you, Commander Kade. That was excellent training. We learned a lot."
    l "Just Lyra. And you're welcome. Practice those formations. We'll drill again tomorrow."

    # VISUAL: Recruits leaving. Chattering. Positive. Energized. Lyra standing alone. Hand on Band. Again. Staring at nothing.

    "{i}She's alone now. Guard down. Exhaustion showing. Not physical. Mental. Emotional. Spiritual maybe. She's running on empty. Has been for weeks. Pushing through. Functioning. But barely. Something's breaking. Or already broken. Just holding pieces together through willpower and terror.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron approaching. Concerned. She doesn't notice immediately. Lost in thoughts. Dark thoughts.

    a "Lyra. You okay?"

    # VISUAL: She jumps. Startled. Hand drops from Band. Forces smile. Unconvincing.

    l "Fine. Just tired. Long training session. Recruits are enthusiastic but exhausting. I'm okay."
    a "You're not okay. You've checked your Band sixteen times in the last hour. Something's wrong."

    # VISUAL: Her face falls. Caught. Can't hide anymore. Doesn't have energy to pretend.

    l "...You were counting?"
    a "I'm always counting. Glass habit. Bad or good depending on context. Right now? Good. Because it tells me you're spiraling. And you're spiraling hard."

    # VISUAL: She looks away. Defensive. Vulnerable. Scared. Doesn't want to admit it. Has to anyway.

    l "I'm fine. The Band's working. It's functional. I'm operational. That's all that matters."
    a "That's not all that matters. You matter. Not the Band. You. Lyra. The person. Not the equipment."
    l "(sharp, defensive) The Band IS me! Without it I'm nothing! I'm just normal human! Weak! Slow! Useless!"

    # VISUAL: She's getting agitated. Breathing faster. Years of suppressed fear surfacing. Breaking through.

    l "Everyone here has something! Zira has contacts and skills! Noelle has intelligence! Tessa has medical expertise! Selene has leadership and experience! You have tactical genius and redemption arc that everyone respects!"
    l "What do I have? What's MY value? I can fight. Because of the Band. I can lead. Because of the Band. I'm Enhanced. Because of the Band. Take that away and I'm NOTHING. Just another body. Just another mouth to feed. Just another person who isn't special at all!"

    # VISUAL: She's shaking. Panic attack building. Band compulsion in full display. Touching it constantly. Checking. Verifying. Terrified.

    l "What if it fails? What if it rejects like Kael's did? What if one day I wake up and it's not working and I'm just... normal? Just weak? Just worthless?"
    l "I was Echelon's proof. The perfect soldier. The Enhanced success story. That was my IDENTITY. That's who I WAS. And if the Band fails, I lose that. I lose ME. I become nobody."

    # VISUAL: Full breakdown. Tears forming. Terror raw. Everything she's been suppressing for months pouring out.

    l "I'm so scared. All the time. Every second. That the Band will fail. That I'll lose the enhancement. That I'll discover I was never special. Never valuable. Never worth anything except the technology on my wrist."
    l "And everyone here? Everyone in resistance? They know YOU. They respect YOU. They follow YOU. Nobody knows me. I'm just... just your partner. Your accessory. Glass's companion. That's all I am. Shadow. Follower. Nobody."

    # VISUAL: She's crying now. Full breakdown. Years of identity crisis and Band dependence crashing down. Can't hold it anymore.

    "{i}She's breaking. Completely. This isn't new. This has been building for months. Since defection. Since losing Echelon identity. Since becoming 'Glass's partner' instead of 'Elite proof.' She lost who she was. And the Band is the only thing tethering her to feeling like she's anything at all. Without it? She thinks she's empty. Worthless. Gone.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron moving closer. Not crowding. Present. Grounding. Careful.

    a "Lyra. Look at me. Please. Look at me."

    # VISUAL: She looks up. Eyes red. Tears streaming. Terrified. Vulnerable. Completely exposed.

    a "You're not nothing. You're not a shadow. You're not defined by the Band. You're Lyra. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: She shakes head. Rejecting. Doesn't believe. Can't believe. Too scared.

    l "That's not enough. Lyra isn't enough. Who is Lyra? What does Lyra do? What makes Lyra matter? I don't know! I don't know who I am without Echelon! Without the Band! Without YOU!"
    l "I'm terrified that if you disappeared, if the Band failed, I'd just... dissolve. Like I never existed. Like Lyra was just construct around Enhanced soldier. And without enhancement? There's nothing there. Just empty space where person should be."

    # VISUAL: Aeron reaches out slowly. Takes her wrist. The one with Band. Covers it with his hand.

    a "Close your eyes."

    l "What? Why?"
    a "Close your eyes. Trust me. Please."

    # VISUAL: She hesitates. Then closes eyes. Breathing ragged. Scared. But trusting.

    a "The Band is covered. You can't see it. Can't check it. Can't verify it's working. Just feel. Just exist without looking. Now tell me. What are you worth?"

    # VISUAL: She's panicking. Breathing faster. Instinct says look. Check. Verify. But she doesn't. Holding still. Trying.

    l "I... I don't... I can't..."
    a "Yes you can. Don't think about the Band. Think about Lyra. What is Lyra worth? Not Enhanced Lyra. Not Banded Lyra. Just Lyra. What are you worth?"

    # VISUAL: Struggling. Fighting instinct. Fighting fear. Fighting years of conditioning that says worth equals enhancement.

    l "(voice shaking) I... I'm tactical. I can plan operations. I can read terrain. I can assess threats and opportunities."
    a "Good. Keep going. What else?"
    l "I'm loyal. I don't abandon people. I stay even when it's dangerous. Even when it's hard. I stay."
    a "Yes. What else?"
    l "I'm... I'm trying to be good. Trying to do right thing. Trying to matter for more than just combat efficiency. Trying to be person, not weapon."

    # VISUAL: She's crying harder but also speaking. Finding words. Finding self. Discovering what's there without Band defining everything.

    l "I'm scared but I keep going. I'm broken but I keep trying. I'm lost but I keep searching. I don't give up. Even when I want to. Even when it hurts. I don't give up."
    a "Keep going. What else is Lyra?"
    l "I'm... I care. About people. About you. About resistance. About making things better. I care even when it would be easier not to. Even when caring hurts. I care anyway."

    # VISUAL: She's finding rhythm now. Finding truths buried under years of Band-dependent identity. Finding Lyra underneath Enhanced.

    l "I'm learning. I'm growing. I'm changing. I'm not who I was in Echelon. I'm not just Enhanced proof. I'm becoming something else. Something more. Something that's just... me."

    # VISUAL: Aeron gently removes hand from her Band. She doesn't immediately look. Eyes still closed. Breathing easier. Present in moment.

    a "Open your eyes."

    # VISUAL: She opens eyes. Looks at him. Then at Band. It's there. Functional. Working. Nothing changed. But everything changed.

    a "Did the Band tell you those things? Did enhancement make you tactical, loyal, caring, determined, growing? Or did you?"

    # VISUAL: Understanding washing over her. Recognition. The Band didn't say any of that. She did. Lyra did. Not Enhanced Lyra. Just Lyra.

    l "...I did. Those were me. Not the Band. Me."
    a "Exactly. The Band enhances your body. Makes you faster, stronger, more durable. But your mind? Your character? Your heart? That's you. That's Lyra. And Lyra is worth everything."

    # VISUAL: She's staring at wrist. At Band. But differently now. Not terror. Not compulsion. Just object. Just tool. Not identity.

    l "I've been thinking the Band makes me who I am. That without it I'm nothing. But that's not true. The Band is what I have. Lyra is who I am. They're separate. They've always been separate. I just couldn't see it."
    a "Couldn't see it because Echelon taught you to conflate them. Taught you that worth equals enhancement. Taught you that you're only valuable when you're useful. That's the lie. That's what we're breaking."

    # VISUAL: She's breathing normally now. Tears slowing. Still overwhelmed but grounded. Present. Found.

    l "What if the Band fails? What if it rejects? What happens to Lyra then?"
    a "Then Lyra keeps being Lyra. Tactical, loyal, caring, determined, growing. You'd have to relearn combat without enhancement. That would be hard. But you'd still be you. Still valuable. Still mattering. The Band doesn't define your worth. You do. Through choices. Through actions. Through who you choose to be."

    # VISUAL: Long silence. Processing. Accepting. Believing. Slowly. Carefully. But believing.

    l "I've been terrified of losing the Band because I thought losing it meant losing me. But it doesn't. The Band is tool. I'm person. Tools break. People endure. I endure."
    l "Even if Band fails, I'm still Lyra. Still tactical. Still loyal. Still trying. Still mattering. That doesn't disappear. That's permanent. That's real. That's me."

    # VISUAL: She looks at Aeron. Grateful. Vulnerable. Changed. Seeing self differently now. Seeing truth.

    l "Thank you. For this. For covering the Band. For making me say who I am without checking it. For showing me I'm more than enhancement. I needed that. I needed to know I'm real. That Lyra is real. Not just construct. Not just proof. Real."

    # VISUAL: Aeron reaching out. Hand on her shoulder. Grounding. Supporting. Believing in her.

    a "You're real. You've always been real. The realest person I know. You just couldn't see it because you were looking at the Band instead of looking at yourself. But now you see it. And you won't unsee it. That's growth. That's healing. That's you."

    # VISUAL: She's smiling through tears. Small. Fragile. But real. Genuine. Hopeful.

    l "I'm still scared. The Band might fail. That fear doesn't disappear because I had revelation. But now I know that if it fails, I don't fail. Lyra continues. Lyra endures. Lyra matters. Band or no Band. That's enough. That has to be enough."
    a "It's more than enough. It's everything."

    # VISUAL: Moment holding. Connection deep. Trust absolute. Partnership stronger. Changed by crisis but stronger for it.

    "{i}She's changed. Can see it in her eyes. In her posture. In the way she's not touching the Band compulsively anymore. The fear's still there. Probably always will be. But it's not defining her. Not controlling her. She's found self underneath. Found Lyra. That's everything. That's what she needed. That's what we all need. To know we're more than our tools. More than our roles. More than what others made us. We're ourselves. Real. Valuable. Enough.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Standing together. Training yard empty. Sun setting. New understanding reached. Foundation stronger.

    l "I should thank you. You pulled me out of spiral. You showed me truth I couldn't see. You saved me. Again."
    a "You saved yourself. I just asked questions. You found answers. That's all you. That's Lyra."
    l "Maybe. But I couldn't have done it alone. So thank you. For being here. For being patient. For being you. That matters. You matter."

label lyra_romance_moment:

    # VISUAL: Intimate moment. Vulnerable. Open. Close. She moves closer. Testing. Asking permission.

    l "Can I...? I need... I need to feel grounded. Feel real. Feel connected. Can I?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron nodding. Understanding. She needs physical connection. Grounding. Proof she's real and valued.

    a "Yeah. Always."

    # VISUAL: She moves into his arms. Holding tight. Not desperate. Not panicked. Just present. Just needing connection. Just being held.

    "{i}She's in my arms. Holding tight. Not clinging. Just connected. Just present. Just being here with me. Proof she's real. Proof she matters. Proof she's more than Band. More than role. Just Lyra. Just herself. Just enough.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: She pulls back slightly. Looking up. Eyes clear. Certain. Choosing.

    l "I love you. Not because you saved me. Not because you're Glass who became Aeron. Not because you're leader or fighter or any of that. I love you because you see me. Real me. Lyra. Not Enhanced. Not proof. Just Lyra. You see that. You value that. That's why I love you."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. She said it. Actually said it. Love. Not convenience. Not dependency. Love.

    a "I love you too. Not because you're Enhanced. Not because you're tactical genius. Not because you're perfect soldier. I love you because you're Lyra. Loyal, brave, caring, growing. I love you because you're you. That's enough. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: She kisses him. Soft. Certain. Real. Not desperate. Not proving anything. Just connecting. Just loving. Just being.

    "{i}She kisses me. Soft. Real. Certain. This isn't panic. This isn't dependency. This is choice. This is Lyra choosing connection. Choosing love. Choosing me. Because she wants to. Not because she has to. Not because she's lost. Because she found herself and chose anyway. That's real. That's love. That's us.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Kiss ending. Holding each other. Comfortable. Real. Changed. Stronger.

    l "Thank you. For seeing me. For loving me. For being here. For being you. That's everything I needed. Everything I need. Just you. Just this. Just us."
    a "Just us. Yeah. That's enough. That's perfect. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: Aeron hugging back. Tight. Supportive. Brotherly. Deep friendship. Real. Important.

    a "That's what family does. We catch each other. Ground each other. Remind each other we're real and valuable. That's us. That's what we do. Always."

    # VISUAL: She pulls back. Smiling. Genuine. Grateful. Friend. Sister. Partner. Not romantic but deeply important.

    # VISUAL: Walking back toward base. Together. Sun setting. Day ending. New understanding beginning.

    l "I should get back to quarters. Process this. Let it settle. Figure out who Lyra is now that I know Band isn't everything. That's big work. Important work. But good work."

That's proof that words matter. That truth matters. That seeing people for who they are matters. She's found herself. Finally. And she won't lose herself again. That's permanent. That's real. That's everything.{/i}"
