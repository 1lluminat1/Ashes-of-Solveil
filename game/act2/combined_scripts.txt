    # VISUAL: Aeron's apartment. Hours after Purge. Dawn breaking. City burning in distance.
    # LIGHTING: Orange glow from fires mixing with cold morning light. Smoke visible.
    # SOUND: Distant sirens; fire alarms; city in chaos; his ragged breathing.

    "{i}ACT 2: FROM ASH{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Fade in from black. Aeron and Lyra still on rooftop where Purge happened.
    # Hours have passed. Dawn approaching. Both hollow, empty, staring at burning sectors.
    
    "{i}Hours pass. Or days. Time loses meaning when the world ends.{/i}"
    "{i}They stand on the rooftop. Watching Sectors 8, 9, 10 burn.{/i}"
    "{i}Smoke rises like monuments. The dead have no graves.{/i}"

    a "{i}We can't stay here.{/i}"
    
    l "(hollow) Where would we go?"
    a "Anywhere but here."
    
    # VISUAL: Lyra looks at him. Both exhausted, broken, barely functioning.
    l "Echelon will be looking for us."
    a "I know."
    l "They'll want to know why you weren't on the command deck."
    a "I know."
    l "Marcus will realize—"
    a "(sharp) I know."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Both processing. Dawn light growing.
    "{i}Silence. The city wakes. Oblivious or pretending.{/i}"
    "{i}Above the Purge zones, life continues. Because it always does.{/i}"

    l "How long do we have?"
    a "Hours. Maybe less. They'll check my apartment first."
    l "Then we need to move."
    a "(looks at her) You don't have to come. This is my—"
    l "(cuts him off) Don't. We burn together. Remember?"

    # VISUAL: He nods. Small. Grateful. Terrified.
    a "{i}We burn together. Glass and glass.{/i}"
    a "{i}Both shattered. Both falling.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Return to apartment. Moving fast. Urgency building.
    # VISUAL: Apartment door opens. Everything the same but different.
    # LIGHTING: Orange glow through windows. Smoke visible. Chaos distant.

    "{i}The apartment. Unchanged. But everything's different now.{/i}"
    "{i}This was home. Now it's a crime scene waiting to happen.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron moves to closet. Grabs tactical gear, not uniform.
    # SOUND: Rustling fabric; zippers; equipment being packed quickly.

    a "{i}What do we take? What matters?{/i}"
    a "{i}Weapons. Credits. Clothes. Everything else is weight.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He pauses at Kael's photo. Hand hovers. Decides.
    "{i}Kael's photo. On the desk. Smiling.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can't leave you behind. Not again.{/i}"
    "{i}He takes it. Slips it inside his jacket. Against his chest.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra gathering her things from bathroom, bedroom. Efficient. Military.
    l "How much can we carry?"
    a "Not much. We'll be moving fast."
    l "Where?"
    a "Down. The Lower Spans. Unders if we have to."
    l "(stops) The Unders? Aeron, they'll kill us there."
    a "Echelon will kill us here. At least down there we have a chance."

    # VISUAL: She processes. Nods. Grim acceptance.
    l "The people you saved. In the Sweep. Some are still there."
    a "Maybe. If they survived the Purge."
    l "They might help us."
    a "(bitter laugh) Help Glass? The man who killed 600 of them?"
    l "The man who saved 200."
    a "That's not how they'll remember it."

    # VISUAL: Packing continues. Clock ticking. Sunrise approaching.
    # SOUND: Distant comms chatter (Echelon channels). Patrol movements increasing.

    "{i}The city wakes. Patrols mobilize. The hunt hasn't started.{/i}"
    "{i}But it will. Soon.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron at terminal. Deletes files. Wipes data. Covering tracks.
    a "{i}Everything. Gone. No trail. No evidence.{/i}"

    a "{i}Marcus will know. He always knows.{/i}"

    a "{i}Glass lived here. Glass died on that rooftop.{/i}"
    a "{i}What walks out this door... I don't know what that is.{/i}"

    l "(hand on his shoulder) Aeron. We need to go."
    a "(nods) Right. Let's move."

    # VISUAL: Door opens. Hallway beyond. Empty. Dawn light filtering through windows.
    # SOUND: Distant elevator chime. Footsteps. Patrol approaching.

    "{i}Footsteps. Close. Patrol coming this way.{/i}"
    
    l "(whisper) They're early."
    a "Elevator or stairs?"
    l "Stairs. Quieter."
    a "Back exit. Through maintenance level."
    l "Lead the way."

    # VISUAL: Moving quickly but quietly through Aeries corridors.
    # LIGHTING: Morning light through tall windows. Marble gleaming. Perfect order.
    # SOUND: Their footsteps muted; distant patrols; comms chatter growing.

    "{i}Aeries. Perfect. Sterile. Cold.{/i}"
    "{i}Marble halls stretching endlessly. Everything clean. Everything controlled.{/i}"
    "{i}They don't belong here anymore.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Past propaganda screens. Messages updating.
    # TEXT ON SCREENS: "RECENT TERRORIST ATTACK CONTAINED"
    # TEXT: "SECTORS 8-10 UNDER EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS"
    # TEXT: "ECHELON PROTECTS. ECHELON PROVIDES."

    a "{i}Terrorist attack. That's what they're calling it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Not genocide. Not Purge. Just... contained threat.{/i}"
    a "{i}100,000 dead. And they call it protection.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: They reach maintenance stairs. Heavy door. Rarely used.
    # SOUND: Door opens with metallic groan. Stairs descending into darkness.

    "{i}Maintenance stairs. Down. Always down.{/i}"
    "{i}Away from light. Away from order. Away from everything.{/i}"

    l "How far down?"
    a "As far as we can go."
    l "The Unders are fifty levels from here."
    a "Then we go fifty levels."

    # VISUAL: They descend. Step by step. Lighting getting dimmer.
    # SOUND: Their breathing; footsteps echoing; city hum growing louder below.

    "{i}Down. Level by level. The city changes.{/i}"
    "{i}Clean to grimy. Bright to dim. Order to chaos.{/i}"
    "{i}And they descend into it.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Passing through Mid Levels. Industrial. Functional. Working class.
    # People starting their day. Factories humming. Life continuing.

    a "{i}Mid Levels. Workers. Families. Normal people.{/i}"
    a "{i}They don't know. Sectors 8-10 burned. And they don't know.{/i}"
    a "{i}Or they know and they're pretending. Because what else can they do?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Someone glances at them. Aeron in tactical gear. Lyra same.
    # Worker looks away quickly. Doesn't want trouble.

    l "We stand out."
    a "I know. Keep moving."
    l "We need different clothes. These scream Echelon."
    a "We'll find something in the Lower Spans. Black market."
    l "With what money?"
    a "(shows credit chip) Aeries credits. Should buy us time."
    l "If they take them. If they don't recognize us first."

    # VISUAL: Continuing descent. Levels blurring together. Getting darker, dirtier.
    # SOUND: Music from below; voices; machinery; city living.

    "{i}Lower Spans. The city's underbelly. Where Aeries refuse looks.{/i}"
    "{i}Neon. Rust. Steam. Humanity compressed and forgotten.{/i}"
    "{i}This is where they swept. Where 800 died. Where 200 lived.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: They emerge into Lower Spans proper. Market district. Pre-dawn crowd.
    # LIGHTING: Neon signs. Flickering. Harsh shadows. Industrial glow.
    # SOUND: Vendors calling. Deals being made. Life surviving.

    a "{i}Sector 6. Near where we swept. Near where they died.{/i}"
    a "{i}The vendor. The child. The families. All gone now.{/i}"
    a "{i}And we're here. Walking among the survivors.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) Do you recognize it?"
    a "Every corner. Every street. Every face I didn't save."

    # VISUAL: People notice them. Conversations stop. Eyes follow.
    # Whispers spread. "Echelon." "Soldiers." "What are they doing here?"

    "{i}Eyes. Everywhere. Watching. Judging.{/i}"
    "{i}We're not hidden. We're targets.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Vendor approaches. Old woman. Weathered. Angry.
    vendor "You're Echelon."
    a "...Yes."
    vendor "You swept Sector 10. Three days ago."
    a "(carefully) I did."
    vendor "My nephew was there. He's dead now."
    vendor "You kill him?"
    a "...I don't know. Maybe."

    # VISUAL: She stares. Long. Hard. Then spits at his feet.
    vendor "Get out of my sector. Before someone less kind finds you."
    "{i}She walks away. Others watching. Tension rising.{/i}"

    l "(whisper) We need to move. Now."
    a "Where? We're exposed everywhere."
    l "Find shelter. Hide. Figure it out from there."
    a "With everyone watching? We won't make it an hour."

    # VISUAL: More people noticing. Hostility growing. Crowd forming.
    # SOUND: Murmurs. "Echelon." "Glass." "Murderers." Anger building.

    "{i}The crowd grows. Whispers harden. Space shrinks.{/i}"
    a "{i}They know me. They remember.{/i}"
    a "{i}Glass killed their families. And Glass is here.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Man steps forward. Young. Angry. Holding makeshift weapon.
    man "You're Glass. I know your face."
    a "..."
    man "Sector 10. You killed my sister."
    a "I'm sorry."
    man "Sorry? SORRY? She was nine years old!"
    man "And you're SORRY?"

    # VISUAL: Crowd closing in. Multiple weapons visible. Nowhere to run.
    l "(hand on weapon) Aeron, we need to—"
    a "(stops her) Don't. We're outnumbered."
    l "Then what?"
    a "...We run. Or we die. Pick one."

    # VISUAL: Man raises weapon. Others follow. About to attack.
    # SOUND: Sudden CRACK. Gunshot. Not at them. Warning shot.

    "{i}CRACK. Gunshot. Echo. Crowd freezes.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Figure appears from alley. Hood up. Female. Armed.
    # Voice familiar. Confident. Amused.

    z "That's enough."

    # VISUAL: Crowd parts. Confused. Wary. The figure approaches.
    # SOUND: Footsteps. Deliberate. Unhurried. Commanding.

    z "These two are with me. Touch them, you answer to me."
    man "Who the hell are you?"
    z "Someone you don't want to fuck with. Now back off."

    # VISUAL: Zira lowers hood. Face revealed. Eyes sharp. Grin dangerous.
    z "Unless you want to find out what happens when you ignore me."

    # VISUAL: Man hesitates. Others uncertain. Zira's reputation precedes her.
    man "(to Aeron) This isn't over."
    "{i}Crowd disperses. Slowly. Reluctantly. But disperses.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira walks to them. Looks them over. Shakes head.
    z "You two are terrible at hiding."
    a "Zira—"
    z "Save it. Follow me. Before they change their minds."
    l "How did you know we'd be here?"
    z "(grins) I've been tracking you since you left Aeries."
    z "Did you really think you could disappear? In those clothes?"
    a "You got my message?"
    z "I got it. And I came. Because apparently you're idiots."
    z "Now move. We don't have time for gratitude."

    # VISUAL: She leads them into alley. Narrow. Dark. Hidden from main street.
    # SOUND: Their footsteps; distant crowd; her confident stride.

    "{i}She moves like she owns the place. Maybe she does.{/i}"
    "{i}We follow. Because we have no choice. Because she's right.{/i}"
    "{i}We're idiots. And we need her.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Deep in alley network. Twisting paths. Zira knows every turn.
    z "Echelon's hunting you. Whole city knows by now."
    a "Already?"
    z "Marcus put out the word. Traitors. Kill on sight. Big reward."
    z "You're famous. Congratulations."
    l "How much time do we have?"
    z "Before Echelon floods the Lower Spans? Hours. Maybe less."
    z "Before locals kill you for revenge? Minutes. Maybe less."
    z "You picked the worst possible place to hide."

    a "Where else could we go?"
    z "Anywhere but here. But too late now. You're here."
    z "So we adapt. Like always."

    # VISUAL: She stops at hidden door. Unmarked. Nondescript.
    # SOUND: Electronic lock. Beeps. Door slides open. Darkness beyond.

    z "Welcome to my safe house. It's not much. But it's yours."
    z "For now. Until we figure out what the hell you two are doing."

    # VISUAL: They enter. Door seals behind them. Darkness. Then lights flicker on.
    # LIGHTING: Dim. Industrial. Functional. Small space. Secure.

    "{i}Small. Cold. Secure. Hidden.{/i}"
    "{i}Not home. But shelter.{/i}"
    "{i}And right now, that's everything.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira tosses them water. Food packets. Basic supplies.
    z "Eat. Rest. Don't leave. I'll be back tonight."
    l "Where are you going?"
    z "To make sure you idiots stay alive."
    z "Echelon's mobilizing. Locals want blood. You're trapped."
    z "So I'm fixing it. Like I fix everything."

    a "Why are you helping us?"
    z "(pauses at door) Because I told you I would."
    z "And because 200 people are alive because Glass cracked."
    z "I want to see what happens when Glass breaks completely."
    z "(grins) Should be interesting."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door seals. They're alone.
    # SOUND: Silence. Just breathing. Exhaustion. Shock.

    "{i}Alone. Safe. For now.{/i}"
    "{i}The city hunts us. Both sides want us dead.{/i}"
    "{i}And we're here. In the dark. Waiting.{/i}"

    l "(collapses against wall) We're fucked."
    a "(sits beside her) Completely."
    l "Echelon wants us dead. Locals want us dead."
    l "We have nothing. No allies. No plan. No future."
    a "We have Zira."
    l "One person. Against a city."
    a "One person who just saved our lives."

    # VISUAL: Long silence. Both processing. Reality settling.
    "{i}Silence. Heavy. Crushing.{/i}"
    "{i}Hours ago, they witnessed 100,000 deaths.{/i}"
    "{i}Now they're fugitives. Hunted. Hated. Alone.{/i}"

    a "{i}From Glass to Ash.{/i}"
    a "{i}Burned down. Nothing left. Just fuel for fire.{/i}"
    a "{i}But fire needs more than fuel. It needs air. It needs spark.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe Zira's right. Maybe this is where we find it.{/i}"

    l "What do we do now?"
    a "We survive. One hour at a time."
    l "And after that?"
    a "...We burn them. Like we said."
    l "How? We're two people against an empire."
    a "Two people who know that empire. Who were that empire."
    a "If anyone can burn it... it's us."

    # VISUAL: They sit. Backs against wall. Exhausted. Terrified. Committed.
    "{i}Two people. One city. Impossible odds.{/i}"
    "{i}But they're here. And they're alive.{/i}"
    "{i}That's something. That has to be something.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Fade to black. Time passes. Night falls. Zira returns.
    # TEXT: "That Evening"

    # canon_note: Aeron & Lyra officially fugitives - hunted by both sides
    # canon_note: Zira becomes crucial lifeline - saves them immediately
    # canon_note: Lower Spans hostile - locals remember Glass, want revenge
    # canon_note: Aeron faces consequences - nephew dead, sister dead, they remember
    # canon_note: Sets up Act 2 theme: earning trust from those they harmed
    # canon_note: Aeries credits may not work in Unders - economy difference
    # canon_note: "Two people against empire" - David vs Goliath setup
    # canon_note: Zira tracking them since they left - she's been watching/helping

# =======================================================


label act2_reality_check:

    # VISUAL: Zira's safe house. Evening. Dim light. Small, cramped, functional.
    # LIGHTING: Single overhead bulb. Shadows deep. Industrial glow through window.
    # SOUND: City hum below; distant machinery; their breathing; exhaustion.

    "{i}That Evening.{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra sitting against wall. Hours passed. Exhausted. Processing.
    # Small space. Concrete walls. One window (barred). Door (locked from inside).

    "{i}Hours in the dark. Waiting. Thinking. Surviving.{/i}"
    "{i}The safe house is small. Cold. But it's shelter.{/i}"
    "{i}And shelter is everything when the world wants you dead.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron staring at nothing. Lyra checking her Band compulsively.
    # Both doing their coping mechanisms. Both barely holding together.

    a "{i}Seven hours since we left Aeries. Feels like seven years.{/i}"
    a "{i}Everything we had—gone. Everything we were—ash.{/i}"
    a "{i}And now we're here. Waiting for someone to decide if we live.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra's hand moves to Band. Touches it. Checking. Automatic.
    "{i}Her hand moves. Wrist. Band. Checking. Always checking.{/i}"
    "{i}Even here. Even now. Terrified it'll stop working.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) Do you think she's coming back?"
    a "Zira? Yeah. She said she would."
    l "People say a lot of things."
    a "She saved us. Twice. Why save us just to abandon us?"
    l "(hollow laugh) Why do anything? Nothing makes sense anymore."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Both staring at nothing. Trauma settling. Reality crushing.
    "{i}Silence. Heavy. The kind that presses on your chest.{/i}"

    a "We can't stay here forever."
    l "Where else would we go?"
    a "I don't know. But this is temporary. Zira made that clear."
    l "Then what? We just... wander the Unders hoping not to die?"
    a "We survive. Then we plan. Then we—"
    l "(cuts him off) We what, Aeron? We're two people."
    l "Echelon has thousands. Weapons. Resources. Control."
    l "What exactly do we think we're going to do?"

    # VISUAL: He looks at her. Both broken. Both questioning. Reality hitting.
    a "...I don't know. But we said we'd burn them."
    l "We said a lot of things on that rooftop."
    l "Rage. Grief. Shock. Words aren't plans."
    a "Then we make a plan."
    l "With what? We have nothing."

    # VISUAL: Aeron looks around. Small space. Minimal supplies. No resources.
    a "{i}She's right. We have nothing.{/i}"
    a "{i}No weapons. No intel. No allies. No future.{/i}"
    a "{i}Just two broken people in a concrete box.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Door lock clicking. Beeps. Opening.
    # VISUAL: Both tense. Hands move toward weapons (they don't have).

    "{i}The door opens. They freeze.{/i}"
    "{i}No weapons. Nothing but fists. And fists don't stop bullets.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira enters. Arms full of supplies. Kicks door closed behind her.
    # LIGHTING: Hallway light spills in, then cuts off. Dim bulb only source again.

    z "Still alive. Good. That's progress."

    # VISUAL: She drops supplies on floor. Food, water, clothes, basic necessities.
    # SOUND: Packages hitting concrete. Rustling. Reality of survival.

    z "Clothes. Food. Water. Fake IDs. Enough to last a few days."
    z "After that, you're on your own."

    l "Fake IDs?"
    z "You think you can walk around as yourselves?"
    z "Echelon's posted your faces everywhere. Bounty on both heads."
    z "Big bounty. Tempting bounty."

    a "How big?"
    z "50,000 credits. Each. Dead or alive."
    z "(grins) Personally, I'd take dead. Less hassle."

    # VISUAL: Both process. That much money could change lives in the Unders.
    a "{i}50,000 credits. That's a fortune down here.{/i}"
    a "{i}Everyone we meet is a potential killer. For the right price.{/i}"

    l "Why haven't you turned us in?"
    z "Because 50,000 credits spends fast. But what you represent?"
    z "That's worth more."
    a "What do we represent?"
    z "Hope. Maybe. Or a really entertaining disaster."
    z "Either way, I'm curious."

    # VISUAL: She sits. Cross-legged. Comfortable. At home here.
    z "Alright. Reality check. You two need to understand where you are."
    z "The Unders aren't Aeries. Rules are different. Culture's different."
    z "Survival's different."

    a "We know it's dangerous—"
    z "(cuts him off) You don't know shit."
    z "You ran one operation down here. One night. Escorted."
    z "That's not knowing. That's tourism."

    # VISUAL: She leans forward. Eyes sharp. Making sure they hear this.
    z "The Unders don't have Echelon law. We have our own."
    z "Barter economy. Favors. Debts. Reputation."
    z "Your Aeries credits? Worthless unless you find the right person."
    z "And finding the right person means asking. And asking means exposing yourself."

    l "What do we do for money?"
    z "You earn it. Work. Skills. Services."
    z "Or you steal it. But theft here has consequences."
    z "Not jail. Not fines. Blood. Always blood."

    # VISUAL: Both listen. Reality settling. Harsher than expected.
    a "What about allies?"
    z "Allies require trust. Trust requires time. Time requires survival."
    z "You've been here seven hours. You almost died twice."
    z "Locals hate you. Echelon's hunting you. You have no leverage."

    a "Then how do we survive?"
    z "You don't stand out. You don't talk. You don't trust anyone."
    z "You stay hidden until I say it's safe."
    z "Which might be never. So get comfortable."

    # VISUAL: Lyra picks up clothes. Plain. Worn. Nothing like Echelon.
    l "How long have you been doing this?"
    z "Doing what?"
    l "Surviving down here. Helping people. Playing both sides."
    z "(pause) Long enough to know when someone's worth the risk."

    # VISUAL: Zira stands. Moves to window. Looks out at city below.
    z "The Unders are 50 levels of humanity compressed and forgotten."
    z "Echelon looks down and sees waste. Criminals. Expendable."
    z "But we're the foundation. The city stands on us."
    z "And when we stop holding it up... it falls."

    a "Is that what you want? The city to fall?"
    z "(looks back at him) I want the people crushing us to fall."
    z "The city? The people? They're just trying to survive."
    z "Like you. Like me. Like everyone down here."

    # VISUAL: She moves to door. Preparing to leave again.

    z "The Unders don't give anything free. Not even second chances."

    # VISUAL: Hand on door. About to leave. Stops. Looks back.

    z "Most of her people died. Sector 10."

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra both tense. Sector 10. Their Sweep.
    a "(carefully) Will she help us?"
    z "Help you? She'll probably want to kill you."
    z "But she's the only real resistance left. Everyone else scattered."
    z "If you want to fight Echelon, you need her."

    # VISUAL: Both process. Marcus. Father. Hunting his son.
    a "{i}Father's hunting me. Publicly. Aggressively.{/i}"
    a "{i}Not quietly disappeared. Not 'training accident.'{/i}"
    a "{i}He wants me dead. And he wants everyone to know why.{/i}"

    a "What's he saying? Publicly?"

    z "That the Purge was necessary because of intel leaks."
    z "He's blaming the 100,000 deaths on resistance activity."
    z "(bitter) And people believe him. Because they always do."

    l "He's rewriting it. Making us the villains."
    z "Of course he is. That's how Echelon works."
    z "Truth doesn't matter. Only narrative."

    # VISUAL: Zira opens door. Hallway beyond. Dark. Dangerous.
    z "Stay here. Don't leave. Don't answer the door."
    z "I'll be back tomorrow. Maybe with good news."
    z "Probably with bad news. Expect bad news."

    a "Zira. Thank you. For everything."

    l "No, I mean really fucked. Aeron, listen to what she said."
    l "Echelon's hunting us. Locals hate us. We have no money."
    l "And the one person who might help us wants us dead."
    l "How exactly do we survive this?"

    # VISUAL: He looks at supplies. Clothes. Food. Fake IDs.
    a "One day at a time. Like Zira said."
    l "That's not a plan."
    a "It's the only plan we have."

    # VISUAL: He picks up fake IDs. Examines them. Basic. Functional.
    # PROP: ID cards. Photos (theirs, slightly altered). Names (not theirs).

    a "{i}Lower Spans worker. Sector 6. Unremarkable. Forgettable.{/i}"

    l "(picks up her ID) Mira Chen. Sector 7."
    l "(hollow laugh) Ironic. Sector 7."
    a "What?"
    l "Nothing. Just... ghosts everywhere."

    # VISUAL: Both stare at fake identities. Their old lives gone. New ones forced.
    a "{i}Kade Voss. Aeron Rylan died on that rooftop.{/i}"
    a "{i}Glass shattered in the Purge.{/i}"
    a "{i}What's left... I don't know yet.{/i}"

    l "I don't know how to do this."
    a "Do what?"
    l "Be nobody. I've been Echelon my whole life."
    l "Perfect soldier. Model citizen. Proof the system works."
    l "Now I'm... Mira Chen. Worker. Nobody. Nothing."
    l "I don't know how to be nothing."

    # VISUAL: He moves closer. Not touching. Just present. Grounding.
    a "Then we learn together."
    a "Neither of us knows how to do this. But we're here."
    a "And as long as we're here, we're not nothing."
    l "(quiet) What are we, then?"
    a "...Survivors. For now. That's enough."

    # VISUAL: She leans against him. Shoulder to shoulder. Exhaustion winning.
    "{i}She leans. He doesn't move. Both too tired for anything else.{/i}"
    "{i}Two people in a concrete box. Hunted. Hated. Alone.{/i}"
    "{i}But not dead. Not yet.{/i}"

    l "Do you think we'll make it?"
    a "I don't know."
    l "Honest answer. Thank you."
    a "We made it this far. That counts for something."
    l "Does it? Or are we just delaying the inevitable?"

    # VISUAL: Long silence. No good answer. Just survival.
    a "Get some rest. Tomorrow might be worse."
    l "Worse than today?"
    a "Always assume worse. Prepare for worse. Hope for better."
    l "(bitter laugh) You sound like a resistance fighter already."
    a "Do I?"
    l "No. You sound terrified. Like me."

    # VISUAL: Both settle in. Makeshift sleeping arrangements. Concrete floor.
    # LIGHTING: Dim bulb stays on (too dangerous to sleep in dark).
    # SOUND: City hum. Distant sirens. Their breathing. Exhaustion.

    "{i}They sleep. Or try to. Bodies exhausted. Minds racing.{/i}"
    "{i}Tomorrow: Zira returns. Maybe with Selene. Maybe with hope.{/i}"
    "{i}Tonight: Just survival. Just breathing. Just existing.{/i}"

# ACT 2 - Scene 3: Safe House Planning (HUB)
# =======================================================


label act2_safe_house_planning:

    # VISUAL: Safe house. Morning light through barred window. Day 2.
    # LIGHTING: Dim gray dawn filtering in. Single bulb still on. Cold.
    # SOUND: City waking up below; distant machinery; footsteps in hallway.

    "{i}Day 2.{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Aeron wakes on concrete floor. Body stiff. Lyra already awake, staring at wall.
    # Both look like hell. Dark circles. Exhaustion. Trauma settling into bones.

    "{i}Morning. If you can call it that. Concrete floor leaves you cold and aching, mind worse than the body.{/i}"
    "{i}Lyra's already awake, staring at nothing. Her hand moves to her Band in that automatic way she can't seem to stop.{/i}"

    a "{i}Day 2 in the Unders. Still alive. That has to count for something.{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Lyra glances at him. Nods. No words. What is there to say?
    l "(quiet) Did you sleep?"
    a "Some. You?"
    l "Not really."
    a "Nightmares?"
    l "Memories. Same thing at this point."

    # SOUND: Door lock beeping. Both tense immediately. Hands move toward weapons they don't have.
    "{i}The lock beeps. They freeze, hands moving instinctively toward weapons that aren't there.{/i}"
    "{i}Still defenseless. Still terrified every time that door opens.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Door opens. Zira enters. Arms full of supplies again. Looks tired but alert.
    z "Morning, fugitives. Still breathing, so that's a good start."

    # VISUAL: She drops supplies. Food packets, water, something wrapped in cloth.
    # SOUND: Packages hitting floor. Rustling. Practical.

    z "Breakfast—protein bars and water. Not fancy, but it'll keep you functional."
    a "You didn't have to—"
    z "I did, actually. You two look like corpses and I can't have you dying before the fun starts."

    # VISUAL: She sits cross-legged. Same comfortable confidence. Owns this space.
    z "Alright, reality check part two. You listening?"
    l "We're listening."
    z "Good. What I'm about to say determines whether you survive the week."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out small datapad. Lists. Notes. Plans.
    z "You can't just hide in here forever. Echelon's hunting and locals are getting suspicious. Word spreads fast down here—two Echelon operatives vanished right after the Purge."
    z "People connect dots fast in the Unders. You need cover."

    a "The fake IDs—"
    z "Are paper thin. IDs get you past casual inspection, sure. But actual survival? That requires integration. Reputation. Proof you belong here."
    z "Right now you're obvious outsiders. That makes you targets."

    l "What do we do?"
    z "You work. You blend in. You earn your place one interaction at a time."
    z "The Unders run on barter, favors, and reputation. You have exactly none of those things."
    z "So you build them. One day at a time."

    # VISUAL: She swipes through datapad. Shows them list.
    z "I've identified seven things you need to survive down here. Call them priorities. You've got about a week before Selene decides whether she'll even meet you."
    z "Use that week to prove you're serious. Prove you're not just Echelon trash hiding in a hole."

    a "What are the seven things?"

    # VISUAL: Zira leans forward. Direct. Practical. No room for negotiation.
    z "First: work. You need money—real money. Scrip that actually spends down here, not your useless Aeries credits."
    z "Your Echelon funds might work if you find the right black market dealers. But finding them means exposure. Better to earn clean."

    z "Second: weapons. You're completely unarmed right now. That's suicide in the Unders. Knife minimum, gun if you can manage it. Something to defend yourselves with."
    z "Everyone else down here is armed and they won't hesitate to use them."

    z "Third: intel. You need to know Echelon's movements and patrol patterns if you want to stay ahead of them."
    z "I have a contact—info broker. Brilliant but weird. She might help if you don't piss her off."

    z "Fourth: medical supplies. People get hurt down here constantly. You want reputation? Save someone's life. Heal someone's kid."
    z "There's an underground clinic with a medic who might help. Or might spit in your face considering Glass's reputation."

    z "Fifth: reputation itself. Do something good. Help someone. Change how people see you."
    z "Locals hate you right now. Change that one person at a time. Escort an elder, protect a vendor—small things that add up."

    z "Sixth: survival skills. You don't know the Unders. The culture, the signals, the territories. I'll teach you. Not because I'm nice, but because you're useless to anyone otherwise."

    z "Seventh: confront your past. Sector 10. The Sweep. You need to face it. There's a survivor out there—someone who remembers, someone who lost everything."
    z "Talk to them. Apologize, listen, whatever it takes. Selene will ask, and if you haven't done it she'll know you're not serious."

    # VISUAL: Both process. Seven tasks. One week. Overwhelming.
    l "That's... a lot."
    z "That's survival. You wanted to fight Echelon? This is step one. You can't fight an empire from a concrete box."
    z "You need allies, resources, skills, trust. None of that comes free."

    a "What about Selene? You said she's considering."
    z "She is. Barely. I told her about the Sweep and the 200 you saved. She didn't shoot the messenger, so that's progress."
    z "But she lost most of her cell in the Purge. Sector 10 was her territory. You swept Sector 10, which means you killed her people."
    z "So yeah, she's considering. Considering whether to meet you or just put a bullet in your head the moment she sees you."

    l "Will she help us?"
    z "Depends. Do these seven things. Prove you're not just hiding. Prove you're willing to work, to change, to actually earn it."
    z "Then maybe she gives you a chance. Or maybe she kills you anyway. Honestly could go either way."

    # VISUAL: Zira stands. Stretches. Ready to leave again.
    z "You've got one week. Seven days, seven tasks. Do them in whatever order you want—I don't care. But get them done. All of them."
    z "Because when Selene agrees to meet, you better have something to show for this week."

    a "Where do we start?"
    z "That's up to you. You're adults. Figure it out."
    z "Just don't do anything stupid. Which, given your track record, is probably a lot to ask."

    # VISUAL: She moves to door. Pauses. Looks back.
    z "I'll check in and leave messages when I can. Help where it makes sense. But I can't babysit. I have my own work, my own problems."
    z "You're on your own most of the time. Get used to it."

    l "Zira. Why are you doing this?"
    z "(pauses) Because someone should. And nobody else will."
    z "And because... I want to see if Glass can become something else. Call it curiosity, call it hope, call it stupidity."
    z "Either way, don't waste it."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door closes. Lock engages. Alone again.
    "{i}Gone again. Leaving them with seven impossible tasks and one week to complete them.{/i}"
    "{i}Everything rides on this. Every single thing.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Both sit. Looking at each other. Overwhelmed but determined.
    l "Seven tasks."
    a "Seven days."
    l "Where do we even start?"
    a "...I don't know. But we have to start somewhere."

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands. Looks at door. The city beyond. Terrifying and necessary.
    a "{i}One week to prove we're worth keeping alive. One week to build something from nothing.{/i}"
    a "{i}Seven tasks. Every single one could kill us.{/i}"

    l "(stands beside him) We do this together. Like everything else."
    a "Together. Yeah."
    l "What's first?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron looks at her. Both broken. Both scared. Both committed.
    a "We figure out who Kade Voss is. Who Mira Chen is. We go out there, we survive, we earn it."
    l "One day at a time."
    a "One day at a time."

    # canon_note: Echelon ambush path: stolen gear, increased alert (+2), reputation hit (-10)
    # canon_note: Scavenge path: old resistance cache, functional but worn
    # canon_note: Weapons added to inventory based on method chosen
    # canon_note: Scrip/credits spent appropriately based on path
    # canon_note: Sets up future: Vex favor can be called in Act 3, Echelon alert affects patrols
    # canon_note: Character growth: Aeron sees difference between Glass carrying weapons and his purpose

# ACT 2 - Activity 3: Gather Intel (Meet Noelle)
# =======================================================


label activity_gather_intel:

    # VISUAL: Lower Spans. Night. Sector 6 rooftops overlooking Echelon patrol routes.
    # LIGHTING: Cold blue-white from streetlights below; neon glow distant; shadows deep.
    # SOUND: City hum; distant patrols; Aeron's breathing; wind through metal.

    #scene bg_sector6_rooftops with fade

    "{i}Day 3. Activity: Gather Intel.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said know your enemy, so I'm learning.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron crouched on rooftop edge. Binoculars (if acquired) or just eyes.
    # Watching Echelon patrols below. Taking notes on old datapad.

    "{i}Echelon patrols move like clockwork—predictable, every 20 minutes, same routes.{/i}"
    "{i}Or they were. Something's changed.{/i}"

    a "{i}The patrol patterns are shifting. Not random though. There's logic here—deliberate adaptation.{/i}"
    a "{i}They're responding to resistance activity somehow.{/i}"
    a "{i}But how? What's the underlying pattern?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He reviews notes. Frustrated. Data incomplete. Can't see the bigger picture.
    "{i}Three nights of tracking and I still can't predict them.{/i}"
    "{i}There's an algorithm here somewhere. I'm just not seeing it.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Footstep. Soft. Behind him. Close.
    # VISUAL: He tenses. Hand moves toward weapon (if acquired).

    "{i}Not alone.{/i}"

    # He spins. Ready. Tense.
    # VISUAL: Figure stands 3 meters away. Female. Mid-20s. Arms crossed. Unimpressed.

    n "You're reading that wrong."

    # VISUAL: Noelle. Silver-blue eyes. Clinical posture. No threat display, just observation.
    # LIGHTING: Cold blue glow from datapad illuminates her face. Sharp. Precise.

    a "Who—"

    n "The patrol shifts aren't random—they're algorithmic. Echelon uses predictive modeling to adapt their routes based on resistance activity patterns."
    n "You're tracking outcomes, the physical movement patterns, but you're missing the inputs that feed their decision matrices."
    n "That's why you can't predict them."

    # VISUAL: She steps closer. Not threatening. Just... analyzing. Like he's data.
    "{i}She moves like she's solving an equation, every step calculated and deliberate.{/i}"

    a "(hand still on weapon) How long have you been watching me?"
    n "Three nights, same as you've been watching them."
    n "You're consistent and methodical, but your analysis has fundamental gaps."

    a "And you're an expert?"
    n "Yes."

    # VISUAL: No hesitation. No arrogance. Just fact. She believes it completely.
    a "{i}No bravado, no performance. She states it like math.{/i}"
    a "{i}Two plus two equals four. She's an expert. Same certainty.{/i}"

    a "Why tell me? Why not just keep doing your own thing?"
    n "Because I need field data—real-time observations from someone who knows what they're looking at."
    n "I can model algorithms, predict shifts, and map probabilities, but I need ground-truth verification to refine my accuracy."
    n "You provide field observations, I provide predictive analysis. Both parties benefit from the exchange."

    # VISUAL: She extends hand. Not friendly. Transactional. Like a business deal.
    n "Noelle Korr. I used to work for Compliance Division as a neural conditioning researcher."
    n "Until I discovered they were rewriting people's memories to maintain social obedience."
    n "I objected to the ethical violations. They objected to my objection. Mutual termination of our relationship."
    n "(matter-of-fact) Now I'm here, underground, and very interested in Echelon's predictive models."

    # VISUAL: He hesitates. Compliance Division. Echelon. But she said 'used to.'
    a "(carefully) You worked for Echelon?"
    n "Past tense matters. I left when I discovered what they were really doing."
    n "They're not just maintaining order—they're erasing cognitive dissent at the neurological level."
    n "I had evidence. They wanted me silent. I declined and escaped with my research data."

    # VISUAL: He takes her hand. Firm. Brief. Professional.
    a "Kade Voss. Observer, currently gathering intel on patrol movements."
    n "'Kade Voss' is an alias, but that's acceptable. I don't require real names for functional partnerships."
    n "Your actual identity is irrelevant as long as your data is accurate."

    # VISUAL: She releases hand. Pulls out her own datapad. More advanced. Covered in notes.
    n "Show me your data and I'll correct your analysis."

    # VISUAL: He hesitates. Sharing intel = risk. But she's right. He needs help.
    a "{i}She's blunt, clinical, no social performance whatsoever.{/i}"
    a "{i}Either completely genuine or the best actor I've ever encountered.{/i}"
    a "{i}But she's right—I'm missing something. And I need answers.{/i}"

    # He shows her datapad. She scans it. Eyes moving rapidly. Processing.
    # VISUAL: Her face: focused, analytical, slight frown (data displeases her).

    n "(scrolling quickly) This is incomplete—surface-level observations with no temporal cross-referencing."
    n "You're tracking current patterns but not historical trends or predictive modeling."
    n "Echelon adapts every 72 hours based on resistance activity metrics. You've captured one cycle, which is insufficient for meaningful prediction."

    a "(defensive) I've been tracking for three nights—"
    n "Right, three nights equals one cycle. You need minimum three cycles—nine nights of continuous observation—before the underlying patterns become statistically visible."
    n "Single-cycle data is essentially noise without context."

    # VISUAL: She pulls up her own data. Screen filled with charts, graphs, models.
    n "I've been tracking for six weeks with historical data, predictive algorithms, and pattern analysis."
    n "Their current patrol model is what I'm calling Adaptive Response Protocol 7."
    n "It shifts every 68 to 76 hours depending on local resistance incidents and sector-specific threat assessments."
    n "(points to map) Next shift happens in approximately 22 hours. Routes will change here, here, and here."

    # VISUAL: She points to specific locations. Precise. Confident.
    a "{i}She's not guessing. She knows this. But how?{/i}"

    a "How can you be sure?"
    n "Bayesian probability combined with historical precedent and pattern recognition. I've modeled their decision-making algorithm across 47 shift cycles."
    n "Current confidence interval is about 89% with a margin of error around plus or minus 4%."
    n "(slight shrug) If you want absolute certainty, you're asking the wrong person. Certainty is irrational in complex systems."
    n "But high probability within acceptable error margins? That I can provide."

    # VISUAL: He stares at her data. Complex. Beyond his training. But... logical.
    a "You really know your stuff."
    n "Yes, that's what I said initially. Are you experiencing comprehension delay or just processing the implications?"

    # VISUAL: Pause. He realizes: she's not being rude. She's literal. No social filter.
    a "{i}She doesn't do sarcasm or hints. Just direct truth.{/i}"
    a "{i}It's almost refreshing after years of performance and masks.{/i}"

    a "No, just not used to people being this direct."
    n "Indirect communication is inefficient and introduces unnecessary ambiguity. I prefer clarity even when clarity creates social discomfort."
    n "Most people find it off-putting, but it reduces misunderstandings by approximately 60%."

    # VISUAL: She closes her datapad. Looks at him fully. Analyzing.
    n "You're military trained—Echelon methodology specifically. I can tell from your observation technique and postural habits."
    n "But you're here gathering intel against them, which creates an obvious contradiction."
    n "(direct eye contact) So which is it? Defector or active infiltrator?"

    # VISUAL: He tenses. This is the moment. Lie or truth?
    menu:
        "Tell the truth (partial)—'Defector. Very recently.'":

            a "Defector. Very recently—less than a week."
            n "(processing) Temporal context suggests defection during the Purge event. Causal relationship?"
            a "Yes. I witnessed it and couldn't stay after that."
            
            n "(nods slowly) That's a logical response to severe cognitive dissonance."
            n "You experienced ethical conflict when your actions contradicted your core values. The system rejected your humanity, or your humanity rejected the system."
            n "Either framing leads to the same outcome—defection becomes psychologically necessary."
            
            a "You're not concerned that I was Echelon?"
            n "Past tense is critical here. 'Was' versus 'is' changes the entire probability matrix."
            n "Your current behavior patterns suggest genuine defection rather than active infiltration. Observable data supports your claim."
            n "(tilts head) Probability you're deceiving me? Approximately 23%. That's within my acceptable risk threshold for potential partnerships."
            
            # VISUAL: She extends datapad toward him. Offering collaboration.
            n "I'll share my predictive models if you share field observations. Together we achieve more accurate predictions and higher survival probability."
            n "Does that sound reasonable?"

        "Deflect—'Does it matter? I'm here now working against them.'":
            $ noelle_trust = 0
            $ aeron_honest_with_noelle = False
            
            a "Does it matter? I'm here now, actively working against Echelon."
            n "(pause) Evasive response. You're declining to provide relevant contextual data."
            n "That indicates either classified information constraints or trust issues, both of which are understandable but complicate partnership dynamics."
            
            a "I'm not trying to complicate things—"
            n "Then provide context. Or don't—but understand that I calculate risk continuously."
            n "Unknown variables increase uncertainty. Uncertainty decreases my willingness to share high-value intelligence."
            
            # VISUAL: She doesn't seem hurt. Just... calculating. Adjusting probability.
            n "I'll share limited data—surface-level analysis only until you prove reliable."
            n "If you demonstrate consistent accuracy and non-hostile intent, I'll increase information sharing accordingly."
            n "Basic trust protocol. Does that work for you?"

    # VISUAL: Either way, she extends datapad. Offering some level of partnership.
    a "Acceptable. And... thank you."
    n "Gratitude is unnecessary for transactional exchanges, but acknowledged anyway. You're welcome."

    # VISUAL: She transfers data to his datapad. Files flowing. Advanced intel.
    # SOUND: Electronic beeps. Data transfer. His pad suddenly much more useful.

    "{i}Her data fills my datapad—charts, models, predictions, analysis.{/i}"
    "{i}More intelligence than I could gather in months. She's sharing it in seconds.{/i}"

    a "This is extensive. You're sure you want to share all this?"
    n "Information hoarded is information wasted. Resistance requires distributed knowledge and redundant data storage."
    n "Also, if you die with this data, I have backups in three separate locations. Risk mitigation."

    # VISUAL: He can't tell if she's joking. Her face: completely neutral.
    a "Right. Risk mitigation."
    n "Was that intended as humor? I detected possible sarcasm but remain uncertain."
    a "Honestly, I don't know either."
    n "Acceptable answer. Ambiguity acknowledged. Moving forward."

    # VISUAL: She moves to rooftop edge. Looks down at patrols. Observing.
    n "Next patrol arrives in approximately 4 minutes. Route designation Alpha-7. Confidence level: 94%."
    n "We'll observe together, verify my model's accuracy, and I'll adjust variables if the prediction fails."

    # VISUAL: They stand side by side. Watching. Waiting. Silence comfortable (for her).
    "{i}She doesn't fill silence with unnecessary words. Doesn't perform socially. Just exists.{/i}"
    "{i}Watching data transform into reality. Equations becoming patrols.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Patrol approaches below. Boots. Voices. Echelon soldiers.
    # VISUAL: Exactly on schedule. Exactly the route she predicted.

    n "Route Alpha-7, exactly as predicted. Model accuracy confirmed."
    n "(small note of satisfaction) Good. I really dislike being wrong."

    a "You do this every night? Predict their movements?"
    n "Daily, yes. Predictive modeling has a calming effect on me—there's something deeply satisfying about finding order within apparent chaos."
    n "It's also functionally useful for survival since avoiding Echelon requires knowing where they'll be before they arrive."

    a "How long have you been down here living underground?"
    n "Six months, three weeks, and two days since I left Compliance Division."
    n "My survival rate has exceeded initial projections, which suggests successful environmental adaptation."
    n "(slight pause) Though I do miss reliable data infrastructure and climate-controlled environments."

    # VISUAL: She says it matter-of-fact. Missing climate control = missing family.
    a "{i}She misses climate control, not people or comfort. Climate control.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can't tell if that's sad or just... her. Just how her mind works.{/i}"

    a "Do you work with others or primarily solo?"
    n "Primarily solo. Social interaction requires significant energy that I prefer allocating toward research and analysis."
    n "But I maintain a small network of contacts—information sources, occasional collaborators. People I can work with on specific projects."
    n "(gestures between them) This qualifies as one. Mutually beneficial and surprisingly tolerable so far."

    a "Tolerable. That's high praise."
    n "(brief glance at him) You haven't annoyed me yet, which is statistically rare. Most people become irritating within the first ten minutes."
    n "You're currently at 15 minutes with minimal irritation. That's promising."

    # VISUAL: They watch patrols disappear. Silence returns. She prepares to leave.
    n "I have sufficient observational data for tonight. I'm returning to run full analysis on the variables."
    n "(transfers coordinates to his pad) Meet me here tomorrow at 23:00. Different location, same purpose. Try not to be late."

    a "What if I can't make it?"
    n "Then I work alone as usual, which I'm accustomed to."
    n "(slight pause) But I'd prefer you attend. Your field observations improve my predictive accuracy by 12 to 18 percent, which is statistically significant enough to justify continued collaboration."

    # VISUAL: She turns to leave. Stops. Looks back. Almost uncertain (rare for her).
    n "Kade. One question before I go."
    a "Yeah?"
    n "Why defect specifically? What was the variable that shifted you from compliance to resistance?"

    # VISUAL: He processes. How to explain the Purge? The guilt? The shattering?
    a "I watched 100,000 people die in minutes because of decisions I made."
    a "And I realized I couldn't be part of that system anymore."

    n "(long pause, processing carefully) Causal guilt combined with ethical crisis. Your entire identity structure fractured when your actions contradicted your core values."
    n "(quieter, more careful) That's... logical. Extremely painful, but logically consistent."
    n "I'm sorry for what you're experiencing. Even though logically, expressing regret doesn't change past events or reduce your pain."

    # VISUAL: She says it awkwardly. Like practicing a skill she's studied but not mastered.
    a "Thank you. I think."
    n "I'm not particularly skilled at emotional responses. They don't come naturally to me."
    n "But the research data suggests empathy improves cooperative relationships, so I'm attempting it."
    n "(slight uncertainty) Was that adequate?"

    a "(small smile) You're doing fine."
    n "(nods once) Noted. I'll continue making attempts then."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Disappears into shadows. Gone as suddenly as she appeared.
    "{i}And just like that she's gone, like she was never here at all.{/i}"
    "{i}But my datapad is full of her work—models, predictions, brilliant analysis.{/i}"

    a "{i}Noelle Korr. Analyst. Former Compliance Division researcher.{/i}"
    a "{i}Blunt, clinical, brilliant, and unexpectedly human beneath all that logic.{/i}"
    a "{i}And somehow I think I just made an ally.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He reviews her data. Page after page. Intricate. Beautiful in its logic.
    a "{i}She sees the world in patterns, algorithms, probabilities.{/i}"
    a "{i}No performance, no masks, no social games. Just unfiltered truth.{/i}"
    a "{i}It's strange and uncomfortable, but there's something honest about it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe that's what I need right now. Someone who can't lie even if she wanted to.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Return to safe house. Report to Zira. Activity complete.
    scene bg_safe_house with fade

    # VISUAL: Zira examining the data Noelle provided. Impressed.
    z "Where the hell did you get this? This is professional-grade intelligence analysis."
    a "Met someone tonight. An analyst who's been tracking Echelon independently."
    z "She? What's her name?"
    a "Noelle Korr. Says she used to work for Compliance Division."

    # VISUAL: Zira stops. Looks up sharp. Recognizes the name immediately.
    z "(low whistle) Noelle Korr. I've heard of her."
    z "Neural conditioning researcher. Absolutely brilliant. She disappeared from Echelon about six months ago."
    z "Word is she stole massive amounts of classified research data. They've been hunting her ever since."

    a "She mentioned discovering ethical violations. Memory alteration programs."
    z "Yeah. She found proof that Echelon was literally rewriting people's memories to maintain compliance."
    z "Erasing dissent at the neurological level. She tried to expose it internally, and they tried to erase her."
    z "(grins) But she got out with her research intact. And now she's working with you."

    a "Is that a problem?"
    z "Problem? Glass, you just partnered with one of the most wanted defectors in Solveil."
    z "(looks at data again) This is incredibly valuable. Keep working with her."
    z "She's probably the smartest person in this entire city, and if she's willing to share intel with you, don't fuck it up."

    a "She wants to meet again tomorrow night. Same arrangement."
    z "Go. Learn everything she'll teach you. This kind of predictive analysis could save dozens of lives."
    z "(serious now) But be careful. She's Echelon's second-most-wanted target after you."
    z "If they find you together, they'll kill both of you without hesitation."

    a "Understood."
    z "Good. Now get some rest. Tomorrow's another day of not dying, and apparently you have a date with a genius."

    # VISUAL: Tessa. Mid-20s. Dark hair tied back. Gentle hands glowing faint green.
    # She's applying bioluminescent gel to burn victim. Speaking softly. Calming.
    # LIGHTING: Green glow from her hands. Organic compound. Healing made visible.

    t "(soft, rhythmic) Breathe. That's all I'm asking right now. Just breathe with me."
    t "In through your nose. Hold it. Out through your mouth."
    t "Good. You're doing so well. I know it hurts, but you're here. You're alive."

    "{i}She works with steady hands. No hesitation. No revulsion. Just care.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands at entrance. Watching. Something in his chest tightens.
    a "{i}She's healing someone I helped create. My mercy triggered the Purge.{/i}"
    a "{i}These burns exist because I saved 200 people. Cascade of consequences.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa looks up. Eyes meet his. Recognition immediate and complete.
    # Her hands don't stop working. Gel continues spreading. Patient comes first.

    t "(quiet, not stopping) You're Glass."

    # VISUAL: Injured man's eyes snap open. Others in clinic turn. Tension spikes instantly.

    # VISUAL: Tessa returns focus to patient. Doesn't look at Aeron. Keeps working.
    t "(to patient) It's alright. Stay still. I'm almost finished."
    t "(to Aeron, calm) Why are you here?"

    a "I need medical supplies. Someone said you—"
    t "I know what you need. I asked why you're here."
    t "(still not looking at him) In the Unders. Alive. When Echelon should be hunting you."

    # VISUAL: She finishes applying gel. Bandages the burns carefully. Tender and precise.
    t "(to patient) There. The gel will keep working for the next six hours. You'll feel it cooling."
    t "Rest now. I'll check on you in an hour."

    # VISUAL: Patient nods weakly. Looks at Aeron with mix of fear and hatred. Says nothing.
    # Tessa stands. Turns fully toward Aeron. Studies him. Not with hate. With sadness.

    t "You caused this. The Purge. These injuries. These deaths."
    a "I didn't—"
    t "Your actions triggered it. That's causation enough, even if you didn't light the fires yourself."

    # VISUAL: She walks to sink. Washes hands. Methodical. Centered. Processing.

    "{i}Judgment rendered before I even explained.{/i}"

    a "I'm not asking for forgiveness—"

    # VISUAL: The question lands like a blade. Clean. Precise. True.
    a "{i}Herself? Both? I don't even know anymore.{/i}"

    t "You could have stayed in Aeries. Stayed Glass. Stayed safe."
    t "But you didn't. Why?"

    a "Because I watched 100,000 people die and I couldn't be part of that system anymore."
    a "Because I'm trying to fix what I broke. Even if I can't. Even if it kills me."

    # VISUAL: She studies him. Eyes deep and warm and infinitely sad. Measuring truth.
    t "You can't fix 100,000 dead, Aeron. You can't patch souls with medicine."
    t "But you can help the living. If that's truly what you want."

    # VISUAL: She moves to cabinet. Opens it. Pulls out medkit. Well-stocked. Organized.
    # Places it on table between them. Offering. Testing.

    t "I'm Tessa Kael. I heal people. All people. Even those who don't deserve it."
    t "(looks at him directly) Which means you too. Despite everything."

    a "Why?"
    t "Because mercy isn't about deserving. It's about choosing."
    t "And I choose to believe you're here for the right reasons."
    t "(slight pause) Prove me right. Or prove me a fool. Either way, I'll have tried."

    # VISUAL: She pushes medkit toward him. Not freely given. Offered with expectation.
    a "{i}She's not forgiving me. She's giving me a chance.{/i}"
    a "{i}Burden of proof. Earn it through action.{/i}"

    a "I don't know if I deserve this chance."
    t "Probably not. But that's not for me to judge."
    t "I heal. You fight. We both serve life in different ways."
    t "(gentle but firm) Take the medkit. Use it to save someone. Then come back."
    t "Show me Glass can do more than cut."

    # VISUAL: He takes medkit. Heavy. Not just weight. Responsibility. Expectation.
    a "Thank you."
    t "Don't thank me yet. Gratitude means nothing until you've earned it."
    t "Actions first. Words after."

    # VISUAL: He turns to leave. Stops. Looks back at burn victim. At others resting.
    a "These people. The burn victims. They're from the Purge?"
    t "Most of them, yes. Survivors from Sectors 8, 9, and 10."
    t "The ones who made it out. Barely."

    a "How many?"
    t "In my clinic right now? Fourteen. In all of Sector 7? Maybe a hundred."
    t "(quiet) Out of 100,000. That's the survival rate."

    # VISUAL: Numbers crushing him. 100,000 dead. 100 survived. Because of his mercy.
    a "{i}My mercy killed 99,900 people.{/i}"
    a "{i}The arithmetic of guilt. It never balances.{/i}"

    t "You're calculating, aren't you? How many died because of you."
    a "How did you—"
    t "I see it in your face. The weight. The math."
    t "(steps closer) Stop counting the dead, Aeron. Start counting the living."
    t "You can't bring back 100,000. But you can save the next hundred."
    t "That's how you fix it. One person at a time. Forever."

    # VISUAL: She says it simply. Like it's obvious. Like redemption is just arithmetic.
    a "That's... a long time."
    t "Yes. It is."
    t "(small sad smile) But you're here. Which means you're willing to try."
    t "That's more than most people manage."

    # VISUAL: Someone calls from across clinic. Another patient needs attention.
    voice "Tessa? I need help over here."

    t "Coming!"
    t "(to Aeron) I have to go. People need me."
    t "(hands him second medkit) Take this too. You'll need more than one."
    t "And Aeron? Come back when you've used them. I want to know who you saved."

    a "You want me to report back?"
    t "I want you to remember their names. The people you save."
    t "(firm) Because Glass killed 600 people. I want to know how many Aeron saves."
    t "Keep count. It matters."

    # VISUAL: She walks away. Returns to patients. Hands glowing green again. Life continuing.
    "{i}She didn't forgive me. Didn't absolve me. Didn't make it easier.{/i}"
    "{i}She just gave me work to do. People to save. A way forward.{/i}"
    "{i}Maybe that's better than forgiveness. Maybe that's what I need.{/i}"

    a "{i}Keep count, she said. Remember their names.{/i}"
    a "{i}600 dead. How many living to balance that?{/i}"
    a "{i}Infinite, probably. But I have to start somewhere.{/i}"

    z "Then you try again. That's what Tessa does. Every day."
    z "She loses patients. She loses people she cares about. But she keeps trying."

# =======================================================


label activity_survival_skills:

    # VISUAL: Safe house. Evening. Day 5. Just Aeron and Zira.
    # LIGHTING: Dim overhead bulb. Shadows deep. Intimate space.
    # SOUND: City hum distant; their breathing; occasional siren far away.

    "{i}Day 5. Activity: Survival Skills.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said I need to learn how to actually survive down here.{/i}"
    "{i}Not just hide. Survive. Blend in. Become invisible.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira sitting cross-legged on floor. Spread of items before her.
    # Clothing, tools, maps, markers. Teaching materials.

    z "Alright, Glass. Time for your education in not being a walking Echelon advertisement."
    z "Sit down. Pay attention. This might keep you alive."

    # VISUAL: Aeron sits across from her. Tired but attentive. Five days of activities wearing on him.
    a "What am I learning today?"
    z "How to be nobody. How to move through the Unders without screaming 'I'm from Aeries, please murder me.'"
    z "Clothing, speech patterns, body language, cultural markers. Everything that separates us from them."

    # VISUAL: She pushes bundle of clothes toward him. Worn. Local. Unders style.
    z "First: you dress like you belong. No clean lines. No military posture in civilian clothes."
    z "Wear this. Look like you've lived here your whole life."

    # VISUAL: He examines clothes. Rough fabric. Stained but functional. Real.
    a "These are... used."
    z "Of course they're used. Nobody down here has new anything."
    z "New clothes mean you stole them or you're Echelon. Both get you killed."
    z "(pushes them) Change. Now. I need to see how you move in them."

    # VISUAL: He changes (off screen). Returns wearing Unders clothing. Feels wrong.
    # LIGHTING: He looks different. Rougher. More real. Less Glass.

    z "(circles him, examining) Better. You look human now instead of weapon-shaped."
    z "But you're still moving wrong. Too precise. Too controlled."
    z "Unders don't move like soldiers. We slouch. We shuffle. We conserve energy."

    # VISUAL: She demonstrates. Her posture shifts. Less confident. More tired. Real.
    z "See? I'm not Zira the rogue anymore. I'm just another worker going home."
    z "Invisible. Forgettable. That's how you survive."

    # VISUAL: Aeron tries to copy. Awkward at first. Too deliberate.
    a "(attempting slouch) Like this?"
    z "No, you look like you're injured. Relax. Let gravity win."
    z "You've been fighting gravity your whole life. Stop fighting. Just exist."

    # VISUAL: He tries again. Better. More natural. She nods approval.
    z "There. That's better. You look tired instead of dangerous."
    z "Tired is good. Tired is normal. Everyone down here is tired."

    # VISUAL: She sits again. Pulls out hand-drawn maps. Territory markers.
    z "Next: territories. The Unders aren't unified. They're fractured into districts, each controlled by different groups."
    z "You need to know who owns what. Where you're safe. Where you're dead."

    # VISUAL: She traces routes on map. Markers. Symbols. Complex web.
    z "Red marks: hostile territory. Stay out unless you want problems."
    z "Green marks: neutral zones. Markets, clinics, public spaces. Safe-ish."
    z "Blue marks: friendly contacts. People I know. Use my name carefully."

    a "How do I know which territory I'm in?"
    z "Graffiti. Tags. Colors. Each group marks their space."
    z "(points to map) See this? Three vertical lines. That's the Rust Collective. Hard people, but fair."
    z "This one? Circle with a dot. The Underlows. Avoid them. They hate Echelon more than most."

    # VISUAL: Aeron studies map. Memorizing. Taking it seriously.
    a "Why are you teaching me this? You could've just given me the map."
    z "Because maps don't teach survival. Experience does."
    z "And I don't have time to save your ass every time you wander into wrong territory."
    z "(slight pause) Also... I need you to survive. For what's coming."

    # VISUAL: Something in her tone. Heavier. More personal. He notices.
    a "What's coming?"
    z "War. Eventually. If we're lucky."
    z "If we're not lucky? Echelon crushes what's left of resistance and we all die anyway."
    z "Either way, I need you ready. Can't have you dying because you didn't know a gang sign."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out small notebook. Worn. Personal. Hesitates before opening.
    z "There's one more thing you need to learn. Language."
    z "Not just words. Hand signals. Code phrases. Ways to communicate without speaking."

    # VISUAL: She demonstrates hand signals. Quick. Precise. Military-esque but different.
    z "This means 'danger.' This means 'move.' This means 'Echelon nearby.'"
    z "These kept resistance alive before the Purge. Some still use them."

    # VISUAL: Aeron copies signals. Muscle memory activating. Learns quickly.
    a "These are... old military signals. Modified."
    z "Smart boy. Yeah, they're adapted from old resistance codes."
    z "My brother taught me these. Before..."
    "{i}She stops. Cuts off. Didn't mean to mention that.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron notices. Carefully approaches the opening she left.
    a "Brother?"
    z "(tense) Forget I said that."
    a "Zira—"
    z "Drop it, Glass. We're here to teach you survival, not excavate my past."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Heavy. She's guarded now. Walls up. But something's cracking.
    "{i}She's hiding something. Something painful. Something that explains her.{/i}"

            z "(quiet) His name was Kai. My brother."
            z "He taught me these signals. Before Echelon killed him."

    # SOUND: City hum fades. Just her breathing. Just this moment.

    "{i}Kai. Her brother. Dead.{/i}"
    "{i}Everything she's done suddenly makes sense.{/i}"

    a "(quiet) What happened?"
    z "(stares at notebook) He tried to defect. Like you. Four years ago."
    z "He was Echelon too. Mid-level operative. Nothing special. Just another weapon."
    z "But he had a conscience. Started questioning orders. Seeing what they really were."

    # VISUAL: She traces hand signals in notebook. Memorizing. Remembering.
    z "He came to me. Said he couldn't do it anymore. Needed help getting out."
    z "I was already underground by then. Rogue. Surviving on my own."
    z "I told him I'd help him. Get him out. Find him a new life in the Unders."

    # VISUAL: Her jaw clenches. Painful memory surfacing. She forces it out.
    z "We planned it for weeks. Every detail. Every contingency. I thought we had it perfect."
    z "(bitter laugh) We didn't account for Marcus Rylan."

    # VISUAL: Aeron goes still. Father's name like ice water. Always his father.
    a "Marcus... knew?"
    z "Marcus knows everything. That's his gift. Omniscient bastard."
    z "Kai made it three blocks from Echelon HQ before they caught him."
    z "Not patrol. Not guards. Marcus himself. Waiting."

    # VISUAL: She closes notebook. Hands shaking slightly. Controlled fury.
    z "Marcus gave him a choice. Return to service, or face execution for treason."
    z "Kai chose execution. Said he'd rather die free than live as Glass."
    z "(voice breaking slightly) Marcus shot him personally. Made example of him."
    z "Broadcasted it. 'This is what happens to traitors. This is Echelon's mercy.'"

    # VISUAL: Aeron's stomach drops. Father's cruelty familiar but still devastating.
    a "{i}Father killed her brother. Made it public. Made it terror.{/i}"
    a "{i}Four years ago. I was eighteen. Still Glass. Still obedient.{/i}"
    a "{i}Did I see that broadcast? Did I watch her brother die and feel nothing?{/i}"

    a "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Zira."
    z "Don't apologize for your father. You didn't pull the trigger."
    z "(looks at him) But you're him. Same escape attempt. Same conscience emerging."
    z "That's why I'm helping you. You're Kai's second chance."

    # VISUAL: Truth settles. Her motivation crystal clear. Redemption proxy.
    a "I'm not your brother."
    z "I know you're not. But you're close enough."
    z "When I saw you crack—when Glass started breaking—I saw Kai again."
    z "Same look in your eyes. Same realization that the system is rot."
    z "And I thought... maybe this time it works. Maybe this time he gets out."

    # VISUAL: She stands. Paces. Energy needing release. Emotion too strong.
    z "I told myself I wouldn't care. That you were just another asset. Another tool."
    z "But I do care. And that's fucking terrifying."
    z "Because if you die... it's like watching Kai die again."

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands. Approaches carefully. She's coiled tight. Vulnerable and dangerous.
    a "I'm not going to die."
    z "(bitter laugh) That's what Kai said. Right before Marcus put a bullet in his head."
    a "I'm not Kai. And I'm not going to let Marcus win again."
    z "You don't know that. Nobody knows that."
    z "Echelon always wins. That's what they do. They crush hope and call it order."

    # VISUAL: He moves closer. Not touching. Just present. Grounding.
    a "Then we change the pattern. We make Echelon lose."
    a "For Kai. For everyone Marcus killed. For everyone we can still save."
    z "(looks at him, eyes wet but fierce) You really believe that? That we can win?"
    a "I have to. Because if I don't believe it, what's the point of any of this?"

    # VISUAL: She stares at him. Measuring. Then something shifts. Decision made.
    z "(reaches into jacket pocket) I have something for you."
    z "Something I've been carrying for four years. Something Kai wanted me to have."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out device. Small. Technical. Advanced. Hacking tool.
    # LIGHTING: Faint blue glow. Precious. Irreplaceable.

    z "Hacking device. Military-grade. One of a kind. Kai built it himself."
    z "Can bypass Echelon security protocols. Slice through encrypted systems."
    z "He was carrying it when they killed him. I recovered it after... after the execution."

    # VISUAL: She holds it out. Offering. Painful to give away but necessary.
    z "I want you to have it. Use it to do what Kai couldn't."
    z "Burn Echelon from the inside. Make Marcus pay."

    # VISUAL: Aeron takes it carefully. Reverent. Understanding the weight.
    a "Zira, I can't take this. It's—"
    z "It's a tool. And tools are meant to be used, not worshipped."
    z "Kai would want someone to finish his work. Might as well be you."
    z "(firm) Take it. Honor him by destroying the thing that killed him."

    # VISUAL: He closes hand around device. Acceptance and responsibility.
    a "I will. I promise."
    z "Don't promise. Just do it."
    z "(slight pause) And Glass? Don't die. I can't watch that twice."

    # VISUAL: Their eyes meet. Understanding. She's not just helping him. She's saving herself.
    a "I won't die. I'm too stubborn."
    z "(small smile) Good. Stubbornness might be what saves you."
    z "Kai was stubborn too. Just not stubborn enough."

    # VISUAL: She turns away. Wipes eyes quickly. Composing herself. Walls returning.
    z "(back to business) Alright. Enough feelings. Back to survival."
    z "You know the territories. You know the signals. You know why I'm invested."
    z "Now you need to practice. Tomorrow you're going out alone."

    a "Alone?"
    z "Can't hold your hand forever. You need to learn to move through the Unders independently."
    z "I'll track you. Make sure you don't die. But you're on your own."
    z "(slight grin) Try not to get murdered on your first solo trip."

    # VISUAL: Despite everything, he almost laughs. Her humor cutting through weight.
    a "I'll do my best."
    z "Your best better be good enough."

    # VISUAL: She gathers teaching materials. Packs them away. Preparing to leave.
    z "Get some rest. Tomorrow's going to be interesting."
    z "(at door, looks back) And Glass? Thanks. For listening. For... caring."
    z "Most people don't bother asking about the dead. Easier to ignore ghosts."

    a "Kai isn't a ghost. Not while we remember him."
    z "(soft smile) No. I suppose he isn't."
    z "Goodnight, Aeron. Sleep if you can."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door closes. He's alone with Kai's device and new understanding.

    - Relationship Deepened: Zira (Trust +2, Loyalty +1)
    
    Zira's Past Revealed:
    - Her brother Kai tried to defect 4 years ago
    - Marcus Rylan personally executed him
    - Zira helping Aeron = second chance for Kai
    - Kai's hacking device now yours—use it to finish his work
    
    You can now navigate the Unders independently.
    Zira will track you but won't intervene unless necessary.
    Tomorrow: Solo navigation test.

    s "Echelon feared us. Marcus knew we could challenge him in open combat. That's why he launched the Purge. Not to stop terrorism. To stop us."

    # VISUAL: She sets datapad down. Numbers don't matter anymore. Just what's left.
    s "Then the Purge happened. Orbital strikes on Sectors 8, 9, and 10. 100,000 civilians dead. And our bases were in those sectors."
    s "Sector 10 main base. 600 fighters. Gone in thirty seconds. Direct hit. Nobody survived."
    s "Sector 8 base. 120 fighters. Collapsed during strikes. Twelve survivors. They scattered. I don't know where they are."
    s "Sector 9 base. 80 fighters. Echelon ground forces hit them during the chaos. Fifteen survived. They fled north. No contact since."

    # VISUAL: Resistance fighters' faces. Grief. Rage. Hopelessness. Holding on by threads.
    resistance_fighter1 "(quiet) What about Sector 12 and 14 bases?"
    s "Abandoned. Echelon knows those locations now. Informants or surveillance. We evacuated before they could hit us. But we left everything behind."
    s "Weapons. Supplies. Medical equipment. Everything that made us dangerous. Gone."

    # VISUAL: Long silence. Weight of loss settling. 847 to 12. Army to squad.
    "{i}847 to 12. From army to squad. From winning to barely surviving. That's what the Purge accomplished. Marcus didn't just kill civilians. He gutted the resistance. And he knew exactly what he was doing.{/i}"

    s "Command structure? Dead. All four division commanders died in Sector 10. Most squad leaders too. Support staff scattered or killed."
    s "I'm the last of the leadership. Just me. And twelve of you."

    # VISUAL: Selene looks around. Meets eyes. Doesn't flinch from reality.
    s "So let's talk about what we have. Current inventory."
    s "Weapons: Eighteen pistols. Four rifles. Low ammunition for all of them. No heavy weapons. No explosives. No body armor."
    s "Supplies: One week of food and water if we ration. Basic medical kit. No surgical equipment. No long-term provisions."
    s "Intel: Some. We have contacts. We have knowledge. But our information networks are broken."
    s "Safe houses: This one. Temporary. Unstable. Echelon sweeps this area. We have 48 hours here. Maybe less."

    # VISUAL: Fighters processing. Some look defeated. Some angry. All scared.
    resistance_fighter2 "So what do we do? Hide? Run? Scatter and hope Echelon doesn't find us?"
    s "No. We rebuild. From scratch. From nothing. We become dangerous again."

    # VISUAL: Some fighters skeptical. How do you rebuild from this?
    resistance_fighter3 "Rebuild with what? We have nothing. Twelve people and scraps. How do we fight an empire with that?"
    s "The same way we built it the first time. One person at a time. One weapon at a time. One mission at a time."
    s "We were 847 once. We didn't start that way. We started with five people in a basement. Sound familiar?"

    # VISUAL: Glances around shelter. Parallels clear. Starting over. Full circle.
    s "We built it once. We'll build it again. Smarter this time. Harder to destroy. More careful who we trust."
    s "Echelon thinks they broke us. They're wrong. They just made us angrier."

    # VISUAL: Aeron watching. Impressed. She's good. Turning despair into determination.
    a "{i}She's good at this. Leadership. Taking a disaster and making it sound like opportunity. I can see why 847 people followed her. Why they died for her.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra beside him. Watching. Processing. Both newcomers to this.
    l "(whisper) Do you think we can? Rebuild from this?"
    a "(whisper) I don't know. But she believes it. That's something."
    l "Belief doesn't stop bullets."
    a "No. But it's what keeps you standing when bullets miss. We need that."

    # SOUND: Door opening. Alert. Everyone tenses. Weapons readied. Visitor.
    "{i}Door. Opening. Everyone tenses. Weapons up. Ready for threat. Ready for Echelon. Ready for death.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA enters. Hands visible. Calm. Expected. Selene relaxes. Others follow.
    z "Easy. Just me. Heard you had new recruits. Came to see if they're still alive."

    # VISUAL: Zira carrying supply pack. Medium size. Heavier than it looks.
    s "Zira. You're late."
    z "Traffic. You know how it is. Echelon patrols everywhere after the Purge. Had to take the long way."

    # VISUAL: Sets pack down. Opens it. Supplies. Food, medical, ammunition. Not much but something.
    z "Brought what I could. Food for three days. Medical supplies. Ammunition for pistols. Not much but better than nothing."
    s "Where'd you get this?"
    z "Don't ask questions you don't want answered. Let's just say some Echelon supply depot is lighter than it was yesterday."

    # VISUAL: Resistance fighters moving to sort supplies. Grateful. Small comfort in darkness.
    resistance_fighter1 "Thank you. This helps. Really helps."
    z "Don't thank me yet. It's three days of supplies. That's all. You need permanent solution. This is just bandage."

    # VISUAL: Zira spots Aeron and Lyra. Moves to them. Smile. Genuine. Relieved.
    z "You're still alive. Good. I was worried."
    a "We made it through the meeting. Barely. Selene gave us a chance."
    z "I heard. Dynamic entrance. Crisis. Resolution. Very dramatic. Very you."
    a "Wasn't exactly planned that way."
    z "Nothing with you is ever planned. But you made it work. That's what matters."

    # VISUAL: She hugs him. Brief. Sisterly. Relief pouring through.
    z "I'm proud of you. Both of you. You joined. You're here. You're doing it."
    a "Doing what? Hiding in a basement with twelve people against an empire?"
    z "Starting. That's what you're doing. Starting the fight. That's more than most people ever do."

    # VISUAL: Pulls back. Looks at him seriously. Emotion showing through usual tough exterior.
    z "Kai never got this far. He tried to defect and Marcus killed him before he could do anything. But you? You made it. You joined. You're here."
    z "That means something. That means he didn't die for nothing. Because you're doing what he couldn't."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. Weight of that. Being Kai's second chance. Living for both of them.
    a "I'll try not to waste it."
    z "You won't. I know you won't. Because I'm going to make sure you don't."

    # VISUAL: Selene approaches. Evaluating Zira. Complicated relationship.
    s "Zira. Thanks for the supplies. And for vouching for these two."
    z "They earned the vouch. I don't give those lightly."
    s "I know. That's why I listened. You're usually right about people."
    z "Usually. Not always. But usually."

    # VISUAL: Moment between them. History there. Respect. Not quite friendship. Professional.
    s "You staying? Or just dropping supplies and leaving like always?"
    z "That depends. You planning something worth staying for?"
    s "Rebuilding the resistance. Hitting back at Echelon. Taking down Marcus. Is that worth staying for?"

    # VISUAL: Zira considers. Longer than usual. Glances at Aeron. Decision forming.
    z "...Yeah. Yeah, I think it is."
    s "(surprised) You're joining? Officially?"
    z "Don't sound so shocked. I've helped before."
    s "You've traded intel and run occasional jobs. That's not joining. That's freelancing."
    z "Well consider me staff now. Permanent position. Benefits included."

    # VISUAL: Selene studies her. Sees something different. Looks at Aeron. Understands.
    s "It's because of them, isn't it? The defectors. You're joining because they're here."
    z "Maybe. Or maybe I'm just tired of watching from the sidelines. Either way, I'm in. You have a problem with that?"
    s "No. No problem. We need everyone we can get. Welcome to the resistance. Officially."

    # VISUAL: Zira nods. Commitment made. Different now. Part of something instead of adjacent to it.
    z "(to Aeron) Guess we're both stuck here now. Better make it count."
    a "Guess so. Thanks for staying. Makes it less terrifying."
    z "Oh it's still terrifying. But at least we're terrified together."

    # VISUAL: Selene calls attention back. More to discuss. Plans to make.
    s "Alright. Back to business. This shelter is temporary. 48 hours maximum. After that Echelon finds us or the walls collapse. Probably both."
    s "We need permanent base. Hidden. Defensible. Room to grow. And we need it fast."

    # VISUAL: Resistance fighters murmuring. Where? How? Everything's compromised or destroyed.
    resistance_fighter2 "Where? Every base we had is gone. Echelon knows the locations. How do we find somewhere they don't know about?"
    s "We scout. We search. We find somewhere new. Somewhere they haven't thought to look."

    # VISUAL: Aeron steps forward. Volunteering. Natural. Necessary.
    a "I'll do it. I'll scout locations. Find us a base."
    s "You? You just got here. You don't know the resistance territories."
    a "No. But I know the Unders now. Spent a week surviving down here. Learning the sectors. Meeting people. Building contacts."
    a "I can find us something. Give me a day. I'll bring back options."

    # VISUAL: Selene evaluating. Sees conviction. Sees capability. Sees asset.
    s "...Fine. You scout. But not alone. You take someone who knows the territory. Someone who knows what we need."
    z "I'll go. I know the Unders better than anyone here. And I know what makes a good resistance base. Done this before."

    # VISUAL: Zira and Aeron. Good team. Practical. Trusted.
    s "Good. You two scout. Find us five potential locations. We evaluate together and choose the best."
    s "Look for multiple exits. Defensible positions. Hidden from Echelon patrols. Room for expansion. We're starting small but planning big."
    a "Understood. When do we leave?"
    s "Now. Every hour we stay here is an hour closer to discovery. Move fast. Stay hidden. Come back with options."

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Zira preparing. Checking gear. Light pack. Fast movement prioritized.
    z "(to Aeron) Ready for urban exploration? It's going to be a lot of walking. A lot of dark places. A lot of hoping we don't run into Echelon."
    a "Sounds like every day since we defected."
    z "Fair point. At least this time we're looking for something instead of running from something. That's progress."

    # VISUAL: Lyra approaches. Concerned but supportive.
    l "Be careful. Both of you."
    a "Always. We'll be back before dark. With options. I promise."
    l "Don't make promises you can't keep. Just come back. That's enough."
    a "...Yeah. We'll come back."

    # VISUAL: Final check. Ready. About to leave. Selene's voice stops them.
    s "Aeron. Zira. One more thing."
    
    # VISUAL: Both turn. Selene serious. Making point.
    s "You're scouting for more than just walls and exits. You're scouting for home. For the place we rebuild from. For the foundation of everything we're going to do."
    s "Don't just find us shelter. Find us something worth fighting for. Something worth defending. Something worth dying for if it comes to that."
    s "Can you do that?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Zira exchange glance. Nod. Understand weight of task.
    a "We'll find it. Whatever it takes. We'll find it."
    s "Good. Now go. Clock's running."

    # VISUAL: They leave. Door closing behind them. Into the Unders. Into uncertainty. Into hope.
    "{i}Out into the Unders. Scouting for home. For foundation. For future. Five locations to find. One day to find them. Everything riding on getting this right. No pressure. Just the entire resistance depending on us finding the perfect place to rebuild from ruins. Simple.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Journey beginning. Sector 6 streets. Morning light. Purpose.
    #scene bg_lower_spans_morning with fade

    "{i}Morning in the Lower Spans. City waking. People moving. Life continuing despite everything. And us moving through it. Looking for the place that becomes everything. The place that becomes home. The place that becomes resistance.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira leading. Confident. Knows these streets. Aeron following. Observing. Learning.
    z "First stop: old subway station. Haven't been down there in years but it might work. Deep underground. Multiple tunnels. Could be perfect or could be death trap. Only one way to find out."
    a "Lead the way. I'm right behind you."
    z "Always are. That's one of your better qualities."

    # VISUAL: Moving together. Into the city. Into the search. Into the future.
    "{i}Into the Unders. Looking for home. Looking for hope. Looking for the place that becomes ours. Day one of rebuilding. Everything starts here. Everything changes here. Find the right place and we have foundation. Find the wrong place and we die slowly. No pressure. Just everything.{/i}"

# ACT 2 - Scene 15: Scouting the Base
# =======================================================


label act2_base_scouting:

    # VISUAL: Lower Spans. Morning. Aeron and Zira moving through streets.
    # LIGHTING: Gray morning light. Industrial. Functional.
    # SOUND: City noise. Vendors. Workers. Life continuing.

    #scene bg_lower_spans_streets with fade

    "{i}Moving through the Lower Spans with Zira. Morning crowds thin but present. Workers heading to jobs. Vendors setting up stalls. Normal life pretending the Purge never happened. Pretending 100,000 deaths don't matter. Maybe that's how you survive down here. By pretending.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira navigating confidently. Knows every street. Every shortcut. Home territory.
    z "Five locations to scout. Subway station, abandoned clinic, warehouse ruins, apartment complex, maintenance tunnels. Full day's work if we're thorough."
    a "And we should be thorough. This is where we're rebuilding from. Can't afford to get it wrong."
    z "Agreed. So we check everything. Exits. Sightlines. Structural integrity. Proximity to Echelon patrols. Water access. Power access if possible."
    z "By the time we're done you'll know more about urban base selection than you ever wanted to."

    # VISUAL: First location ahead. Old subway entrance. Boarded up. Forgotten.
    z "First stop. Old subway station. Used to run through here decades ago before Echelon shut it down. Built new transit above ground where they could monitor everything."
    z "Left the old tunnels to rot. Perfect for people who want to hide from monitoring."

    # TRANSITION: Descending into subway. Dark. Damp. Underground.
    #scene bg_subway_station_old with fade

    "{i}Down into darkness. Old subway station. Tiles cracked. Water dripping. Smell of mold and rust. Emergency lights flickering on motion sensors. Place has been abandoned for years but infrastructure's still here. Rails. Platforms. Tunnels stretching into darkness.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Exploring. Zira checking exits. Aeron examining structure. Professional assessment.
    z "Multiple tunnels. At least six directions from this central platform. That's good. Means multiple escape routes if Echelon finds us."
    a "Structure looks solid. No major cracks in the support columns. Water damage but nothing catastrophic. Could be reinforced easily enough."
    z "Power lines are intact. Old but intact. Could tap into city grid without anyone noticing. That's electricity sorted."
    a "What about water?"
    z "Maintenance tunnels should have access to city water mains. Not drinking quality but filterable. Better than nothing."

    # VISUAL: Checking deeper. Finding spaces. Rooms. Potential.
    z "Platform level could be living quarters. Service rooms for operations. Tunnels for storage and escape. This could work."
    a "It's dark though. No natural light. That'll affect morale long-term. Living underground does things to people."
    z "True. But it's also the hardest to find. Echelon doesn't patrol underground. Too many tunnels. Too easy to get lost. That's operational security."

    # VISUAL: Taking notes. Mental map. Pros and cons. Moving on.
    a "One down. Four to go. What's next?"
    z "Abandoned clinic. Sector 7. Tessa's territory actually. She might have opinions on using it."

    # TRANSITION: Back above ground. Journey to Sector 7. Walking. Talking.
    #scene bg_lower_spans_day with fade

    "{i}Back above ground. Sunlight feels harsh after subway darkness. Moving toward Sector 7. Twenty minute walk. Zira knows shortcuts. I follow. Good rhythm. Comfortable silence between us. Easy partnership.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Conversation starting. Light. Building rapport.
    a "How long have you been doing this? Scouting bases. Running operations."
    z "Years. Since I was sixteen. Started as courier. Moved up to intel gathering. Eventually became independent contractor. Work for whoever pays or whoever's cause I believe in."
    a "And now you're staff. Permanent position. How's that feel?"
    z "(considers) Strange. Good strange. I've always been peripheral. Adjacent to causes but never fully in them. Safer that way. Less commitment. Less risk."
    z "But also lonelier. Watching from outside. Never quite belonging."

    # VISUAL: Vulnerability showing. Small. But there.
    a "What changed? Why commit now?"
    z "...You. Honestly. You changed it. Watching you crack and break and rebuild. Watching you choose something hard because it was right. That made me think maybe I should stop watching and start doing."
    a "No pressure then."
    z "(laughs) All the pressure. But good pressure. The kind that makes you better instead of breaking you."

    # VISUAL: Arriving at abandoned clinic. Sector 7. Medical signage faded but visible.
    #scene bg_abandoned_clinic with fade

    "{i}Abandoned clinic. Sector 7. Three story building. Windows broken. Doors hanging off hinges. But structure intact. Medical signage still visible. This was real clinic once. Helping people. Now empty. Waiting. Could help people again.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Exploring. Exam rooms. Storage. Operating theater. Medical infrastructure intact.
    z "This is solid. Exam rooms can become living quarters. Operating theater for actual medical work. Storage rooms for weapons and supplies. Three floors means vertical compartmentalization."
    a "Above ground though. Visible. Echelon patrols Sector 7 regularly. Higher risk of discovery."
    z "True. But also legitimate building. Clinic reopening wouldn't be suspicious. Could blend with civilian population. Operational cover."

    # VISUAL: Finding medical equipment. Old but usable. Cabinets. Exam tables. Surgical tools.
    a "Equipment's still here. Outdated but functional. Tessa would love this. She could actually do proper medicine instead of field triage."
    z "She'd probably argue for this location hard. It's her territory. She knows the locals. They know her. That's built-in community support."
    a "That's valuable. Resistance needs locals on their side. Can't fight Echelon and local hostility simultaneously."

    # VISUAL: Noting pros and cons. Moving on. Third location.
    z "Alright. Three down. Warehouse ruins next. That one's... complicated for me."
    a "Complicated how?"
    z "(quiet) Kai and I used to operate out of that area. Lot of memories there. Good and bad. Mostly bad now."

    # TRANSITION: Journey to warehouse. Longer. Gives time for deeper conversation.
    #scene bg_lower_spans_afternoon with fade

    "{i}Walking toward warehouse district. Afternoon now. Crowds thicker. More people. More noise. Easier to blend. Harder to talk privately. We stick to less traveled paths. Alleys. Maintenance corridors. Places where conversations stay private.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira quieter now. Memories surfacing. Grief showing through usual toughness.
    z "Kai loved the warehouses. Said they reminded him of possibility. Big empty spaces waiting to be filled with something better than Echelon's control."
    z "We'd sit on the roofs at night. Looking at the city. Planning escapes that never happened. Talking about futures that didn't exist."
    z "He'd say 'One day we'll fill these warehouses with people who choose to be here. Not people forced to stay. Real community. Real choice.'"

    # VISUAL: Aeron listening. Giving space. Letting her talk. Grief needs witness.
    a "He sounds like he had vision. Hope. That's rare down here."
    z "He did. Too much hope maybe. Made him reckless. Made him think he could defect without consequences. That Marcus would let him go because... because why? Because hope wins? It doesn't. Bullets win. And Marcus had more bullets."

    # VISUAL: Arriving at warehouse ruins. Partially collapsed. Massive. Empty. Haunted.
    #scene bg_warehouse_ruins with fade

    "{i}Warehouse ruins. Massive. Five stories. Partially collapsed on east side but west side intact. Huge open spaces. Multiple levels. Catwalks. Loading docks. Storage areas. Could hold hundred people easily. Could hold army if we rebuilt it properly. Could hold everything. Or could collapse and kill everyone. Both possible.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira stops. Staring. Memories flooding. Pain visible now. Grief raw.
    z "(quiet) There. That catwalk. Third level. That's where we sat. Where he told me he was going to defect. Where I tried to talk him out of it."
    z "I knew it was suicide. I told him. Begged him to wait. To plan better. To let me help. He wouldn't listen."
    z "Said waiting was just slow death. That he'd rather die trying than live complying. And he did. Die trying. Marcus made sure of it."

    # VISUAL: She's shaking. Grief and rage mixing. Barely holding together.
    z "He was 23. Just 23. Had his whole life. Had potential. Had dreams. And Marcus executed him on broadcast. Made him example. Made him warning. 'This is what happens when you resist.'"
    z "I watched. They made everyone watch. Echelon streamed it everywhere. 'Traitor's death.' He was so scared but he didn't beg. Didn't give them satisfaction. Died defiant. Died brave."
    z "And I couldn't save him. Couldn't stop it. Could only watch him die and know I failed."

    # VISUAL: Tears now. Openly crying. Toughness cracked. Grief pouring through.
    "{i}She's crying. Zira's crying. I've never seen her cry. Never seen her crack. She's always steel and sharp edges and dark humor. But right now she's just person who lost her brother. Just sister grieving. Just human breaking.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron moves to her. Not touching yet. Present. Witness. Support.
    a "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You shouldn't have had to watch that. Nobody should."
    z "(voice breaking) Four years. It's been four years and it still feels like yesterday. Still see his face. Still hear the gunshot. Still wake up thinking maybe I can change it. Maybe I can save him. But I can't. Can never. He's just gone."

    # VISUAL: Overwhelmed. Needs something. Anchor. Connection. Proof feeling good still possible.
    z "I'm tired, Aeron. So tired of losing people. Of watching them die. Of carrying their ghosts. I'm tired of being alone with all this grief."

    # VISUAL: She looks at him. Vulnerable. Desperate. Need clear.
    z "Can I... can I try something? Just once. Just to see if feeling something good is still possible after everything."

    # VISUAL: Aeron confused but gentle. Sensing vulnerability. Being careful.
    a "Try what?"

    # VISUAL: Decision made. Impulsive. Necessary. Vulnerable.
    z "This."

# =======================================================

label zira_kiss_scene:

    # VISUAL: Zira closes distance. Kisses him. Soft. Not rushed. Intentional.
    # SOUND: Silence except breathing. City noise distant. This moment isolated.

    "{i}She kisses me. Soft but certain. Not frantic. Not desperate. Deliberate. Her hand comes up to my chest. Not pushing away. Just resting there. Feeling heartbeat. Grounding herself in something real. Something present. Something alive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Kiss lasting. Not quick peck. Real kiss. Tender. Meaningful. Time stretching.
    "{i}Time stretches. Seconds becoming minutes becoming moment that exists outside normal time. Her lips soft against mine. Warm. Real. She tastes like coffee and determination and grief being held at bay. She's not pulling away. Not rushing. Just present. Just here. Just kissing me like she means it.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Her other hand moves to his shoulder. Steadying herself. Or him. Or both.
    "{i}Her other hand finds my shoulder. Holding on. Not desperate grip. Just connection. Anchor. We're standing in ruins of her brother's dreams and she's kissing me and it feels like both ending and beginning. Like grief finding outlet. Like hope finding form.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Finally pulls back. Slowly. Not jerking away. Gentle separation. Eyes opening.
    "{i}She pulls back slowly. Eyes still closed for beat longer. Then opening. Looking at me. Searching my face for reaction. For judgment. For rejection. For anything that says I regret this. That she shouldn't have done this.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira's face. Vulnerable. Scared. But also... relieved. Soft. Open.
    z "(breathless, quiet) I've been wanting to do that. For weeks maybe. Since you saved me from that crowd. Since you kept your promises. Since you became someone who made me feel less alone."

    # VISUAL: Not backing away. Still close. Hand still on his chest. Comfortable.
    z "I told myself it was just proximity. Just survival bonding. Just Kai projection. But it's not. It's you. Specifically you. The way you crack jokes when everything's terrible. The way you keep promises even when they cost you. The way you see me as person instead of weapon."

    # VISUAL: Small smile forming. Real. Not her usual dark humor shield. Genuine.
    z "I needed to know if feeling something good was still possible. But that's not the whole truth. I needed to know if feeling something good with YOU was possible. If this thing I've been feeling was real or just grief making me delusional."

    # VISUAL: Aeron's hand comes up. Gentle. Touches her face. Soft. Careful.
    a "...And? Was it real?"

    # VISUAL: Zira leaning into touch. Eyes closing briefly. Savoring comfort. Safety.
    z "(soft laugh, eyes still closed) Yeah. So real it's terrifying. I felt... not broken. Not alone. Not just surviving. Actually present. Actually human. Actually wanting something instead of just enduring everything."

    # ==============================================================
    # LOCATION PRESENTATIONS
    # ==============================================================

    # LOCATION 1: SUBWAY STATION
    a "First option: Old subway station. Deep underground. Multiple tunnel exits. Central location with access to multiple sectors."
    a "Pros: Hardest to detect. Multiple escape routes. Existing infrastructure including power and water access. Secure."
    a "Cons: No natural light. Claustrophobic. Echelon knows old subway maps. Morale impact from underground living."

    # VISUAL: Noelle steps forward. Data-driven advocacy.
    n "Mathematical analysis shows subway station has optimal connectivity index. Central hub position allows 91% coverage of Lower Spans sectors within 15-minute response time."
    n "Predictive algorithms show lowest Echelon patrol probability in tunnel networks. 8.3% chance of discovery per month versus 23-31% for above-ground options."
    n "Infrastructure analysis indicates sustainability rating of 91%. Power, water, ventilation all present. Minimal additional resource investment required."
    n "Recommendation: Subway station. Data supports this conclusion."

    # LOCATION 2: ABANDONED CLINIC
    a "Second option: Abandoned clinic. Sector 7. Three stories. Existing medical infrastructure. Above ground visibility."
    a "Pros: Medical equipment intact. Proper healing facilities. Sector 7 community connections through Tessa. Operational cover as reopened clinic."
    a "Cons: More visible. Higher Echelon patrol frequency. Single entrance creates defensive vulnerability."

    # VISUAL: Tessa steps forward. Humanitarian advocacy.
    t "The clinic lets us heal properly. Not just patch wounds but actually treat people. Trauma, surgery, recovery. Everything resistance needs to keep fighters operational."
    t "Sector 7 knows me. Locals would support us. We'd have community foundation. Can't fight Echelon while fighting local hostility."
    t "And operationally, clinic reopening isn't suspicious. Medical care's always needed. Perfect cover. We hide by helping."
    t "Count the living means keeping them alive long enough to matter. Clinic does that better than any other option."

    # LOCATION 3: WAREHOUSE RUINS
    a "Third option: Warehouse ruins. Massive space. Multiple levels. Partially collapsed but repairable."
    a "Pros: Largest space. Room for expansion. Near smuggling routes. Could hold hundred fighters eventually."
    a "Cons: Structural instability. Requires significant reinforcement. More exposed with multiple access points."

    # VISUAL: Zira steps forward. Practical advocacy with emotional undertone.
    z "Warehouse gives us room to grow. We're twelve now. Won't stay twelve. Need space for recruitment. Training. Operations. Warehouse provides that."
    z "I know the smuggling routes around that area. Can get supplies in quietly. That's strategic advantage. Logistics matter as much as location."
    z "And yes, it needs work. But we're building resistance from scratch anyway. Might as well build big. Plan for success instead of just survival."

        z "(quieter) Plus... it's where my brother and I used to dream about real resistance. About filling empty spaces with people who chose to be there. Honoring that feels right."

    # LOCATION 4: APARTMENT COMPLEX
    a "Fourth option: Fortified apartment complex. Eight stories. Residential disguise. Tactical advantages."
    a "Pros: Multiple levels. High ground. Rooftop access for observation. Blends with civilian population. Compartmentalized operations."
    a "Cons: Civilians nearby. Risk of collateral. Limited escape routes due to vertical structure."

    # VISUAL: Lyra steps forward. Military advocacy.
    l "Apartment complex offers best defensive position. High ground advantage. Multiple firing positions. Clear sightlines for early warning."
    l "Eight stories means we control vertical space. Echelon assaults from ground level. We rain hell from above. Tactical superiority."
    l "Compartmentalization through separate apartments means operational security. Compromised unit doesn't compromise everything. Military best practice."
    l "And residential disguise works. Echelon patrols but doesn't aggressively search empty residential. We're hidden in plain sight."

    # LOCATION 5: MAINTENANCE TUNNELS
    a "Fifth option: Maintenance tunnels. City infrastructure. Hidden. Uncomfortable. Mobile."
    a "Pros: Completely unknown to Echelon. Can relocate within tunnel network. Flexible. Secret. Safe through obscurity."
    a "Cons: Cramped. Uncomfortable. Morale impact. Maintenance worker discovery risk."

    # VISUAL: Selene steps forward. Survival advocacy.
    s "Maintenance tunnels are safest. Not on any map Echelon has. Unknown. Hidden. That's security through information gap."
    s "Comfort doesn't keep you alive. Security does. Down here survival comes first. Comfort's luxury for when we've won."
    s "Network spans entire Lower Spans. We can move. Relocate. Never be pinned down. Echelon can't destroy what they can't find. That's how we outlast them."
    s "I vote tunnels. But I'm not dictator. Everyone gets input. This is collective choice."
