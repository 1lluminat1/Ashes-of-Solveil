    # VISUAL: Aeron's apartment. Hours after Purge. Dawn breaking. City burning in distance.
    # LIGHTING: Orange glow from fires mixing with cold morning light. Smoke visible.
    # SOUND: Distant sirens; fire alarms; city in chaos; his ragged breathing.

    "{i}ACT 2: FROM ASH{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Fade in from black. Aeron and Lyra still on rooftop where Purge happened.
    # Hours have passed. Dawn approaching. Both hollow, empty, staring at burning sectors.
    
    "{i}Hours pass. Or days. Time loses meaning when the world ends.{/i}"
    "{i}They stand on the rooftop. Watching Sectors 8, 9, 10 burn.{/i}"
    "{i}Smoke rises like monuments. The dead have no graves.{/i}"

    a "{i}We can't stay here.{/i}"
    
    l "(hollow) Where would we go?"
    a "Anywhere but here."
    
    # VISUAL: Lyra looks at him. Both exhausted, broken, barely functioning.
    l "Echelon will be looking for us."
    a "I know."
    l "They'll want to know why you weren't on the command deck."
    a "I know."
    l "Marcus will realize—"
    a "(sharp) I know."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Both processing. Dawn light growing.
    "{i}Silence. The city wakes. Oblivious or pretending.{/i}"
    "{i}Above the Purge zones, life continues. Because it always does.{/i}"

    l "How long do we have?"
    a "Hours. Maybe less. They'll check my apartment first."
    l "Then we need to move."
    a "(looks at her) You don't have to come. This is my—"
    l "(cuts him off) Don't. We burn together. Remember?"

    # VISUAL: He nods. Small. Grateful. Terrified.
    a "{i}We burn together. Glass and glass.{/i}"
    a "{i}Both shattered. Both falling.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Return to apartment. Moving fast. Urgency building.
    # VISUAL: Apartment door opens. Everything the same but different.
    # LIGHTING: Orange glow through windows. Smoke visible. Chaos distant.

    "{i}The apartment. Unchanged. But everything's different now.{/i}"
    "{i}This was home. Now it's a crime scene waiting to happen.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron moves to closet. Grabs tactical gear, not uniform.
    # SOUND: Rustling fabric; zippers; equipment being packed quickly.

    a "{i}What do we take? What matters?{/i}"
    a "{i}Weapons. Credits. Clothes. Everything else is weight.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He pauses at Kael's photo. Hand hovers. Decides.
    "{i}Kael's photo. On the desk. Smiling.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can't leave you behind. Not again.{/i}"
    "{i}He takes it. Slips it inside his jacket. Against his chest.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra gathering her things from bathroom, bedroom. Efficient. Military.
    l "How much can we carry?"
    a "Not much. We'll be moving fast."
    l "Where?"
    a "Down. The Lower Spans. Unders if we have to."
    l "(stops) The Unders? Aeron, they'll kill us there."
    a "Echelon will kill us here. At least down there we have a chance."

    # VISUAL: She processes. Nods. Grim acceptance.
    l "The people you saved. In the Sweep. Some are still there."
    a "Maybe. If they survived the Purge."
    l "They might help us."
    a "(bitter laugh) Help Glass? The man who killed 600 of them?"
    l "The man who saved 200."
    a "That's not how they'll remember it."

    # VISUAL: Packing continues. Clock ticking. Sunrise approaching.
    # SOUND: Distant comms chatter (Echelon channels). Patrol movements increasing.

    "{i}The city wakes. Patrols mobilize. The hunt hasn't started.{/i}"
    "{i}But it will. Soon.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron at terminal. Deletes files. Wipes data. Covering tracks.
    a "{i}Everything. Gone. No trail. No evidence.{/i}"

    a "{i}Marcus will know. He always knows.{/i}"

    a "{i}Glass lived here. Glass died on that rooftop.{/i}"
    a "{i}What walks out this door... I don't know what that is.{/i}"

    l "(hand on his shoulder) Aeron. We need to go."
    a "(nods) Right. Let's move."

    # VISUAL: Door opens. Hallway beyond. Empty. Dawn light filtering through windows.
    # SOUND: Distant elevator chime. Footsteps. Patrol approaching.

    "{i}Footsteps. Close. Patrol coming this way.{/i}"
    
    l "(whisper) They're early."
    a "Elevator or stairs?"
    l "Stairs. Quieter."
    a "Back exit. Through maintenance level."
    l "Lead the way."

    # VISUAL: Moving quickly but quietly through Aeries corridors.
    # LIGHTING: Morning light through tall windows. Marble gleaming. Perfect order.
    # SOUND: Their footsteps muted; distant patrols; comms chatter growing.

    "{i}Aeries. Perfect. Sterile. Cold.{/i}"
    "{i}Marble halls stretching endlessly. Everything clean. Everything controlled.{/i}"
    "{i}They don't belong here anymore.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Past propaganda screens. Messages updating.
    # TEXT ON SCREENS: "RECENT TERRORIST ATTACK CONTAINED"
    # TEXT: "SECTORS 8-10 UNDER EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS"
    # TEXT: "ECHELON PROTECTS. ECHELON PROVIDES."

    a "{i}Terrorist attack. That's what they're calling it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Not genocide. Not Purge. Just... contained threat.{/i}"
    a "{i}100,000 dead. And they call it protection.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: They reach maintenance stairs. Heavy door. Rarely used.
    # SOUND: Door opens with metallic groan. Stairs descending into darkness.

    "{i}Maintenance stairs. Down. Always down.{/i}"
    "{i}Away from light. Away from order. Away from everything.{/i}"

    l "How far down?"
    a "As far as we can go."
    l "The Unders are fifty levels from here."
    a "Then we go fifty levels."

    # VISUAL: They descend. Step by step. Lighting getting dimmer.
    # SOUND: Their breathing; footsteps echoing; city hum growing louder below.

    "{i}Down. Level by level. The city changes.{/i}"
    "{i}Clean to grimy. Bright to dim. Order to chaos.{/i}"
    "{i}And they descend into it.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Passing through Mid Levels. Industrial. Functional. Working class.
    # People starting their day. Factories humming. Life continuing.

    a "{i}Mid Levels. Workers. Families. Normal people.{/i}"
    a "{i}They don't know. Sectors 8-10 burned. And they don't know.{/i}"
    a "{i}Or they know and they're pretending. Because what else can they do?{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Someone glances at them. Aeron in tactical gear. Lyra same.
    # Worker looks away quickly. Doesn't want trouble.

    l "We stand out."
    a "I know. Keep moving."
    l "We need different clothes. These scream Echelon."
    a "We'll find something in the Lower Spans. Black market."
    l "With what money?"
    a "(shows credit chip) Aeries credits. Should buy us time."
    l "If they take them. If they don't recognize us first."

    # VISUAL: Continuing descent. Levels blurring together. Getting darker, dirtier.
    # SOUND: Music from below; voices; machinery; city living.

    "{i}Lower Spans. The city's underbelly. Where Aeries refuse looks.{/i}"
    "{i}Neon. Rust. Steam. Humanity compressed and forgotten.{/i}"
    "{i}This is where they swept. Where 800 died. Where 200 lived.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: They emerge into Lower Spans proper. Market district. Pre-dawn crowd.
    # LIGHTING: Neon signs. Flickering. Harsh shadows. Industrial glow.
    # SOUND: Vendors calling. Deals being made. Life surviving.

    a "{i}Sector 6. Near where we swept. Near where they died.{/i}"
    a "{i}The vendor. The child. The families. All gone now.{/i}"
    a "{i}And we're here. Walking among the survivors.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) Do you recognize it?"
    a "Every corner. Every street. Every face I didn't save."

    # VISUAL: People notice them. Conversations stop. Eyes follow.
    # Whispers spread. "Echelon." "Soldiers." "What are they doing here?"

    "{i}Eyes. Everywhere. Watching. Judging.{/i}"
    "{i}We're not hidden. We're targets.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Vendor approaches. Old woman. Weathered. Angry.
    vendor "You're Echelon."
    a "...Yes."
    vendor "You swept Sector 10. Three days ago."
    a "(carefully) I did."
    vendor "My nephew was there. He's dead now."
    vendor "You kill him?"
    a "...I don't know. Maybe."

    # VISUAL: She stares. Long. Hard. Then spits at his feet.
    vendor "Get out of my sector. Before someone less kind finds you."
    "{i}She walks away. Others watching. Tension rising.{/i}"

    l "(whisper) We need to move. Now."
    a "Where? We're exposed everywhere."
    l "Find shelter. Hide. Figure it out from there."
    a "With everyone watching? We won't make it an hour."

    # VISUAL: More people noticing. Hostility growing. Crowd forming.
    # SOUND: Murmurs. "Echelon." "Glass." "Murderers." Anger building.

    "{i}The crowd grows. Whispers harden. Space shrinks.{/i}"
    a "{i}They know me. They remember.{/i}"
    a "{i}Glass killed their families. And Glass is here.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Man steps forward. Young. Angry. Holding makeshift weapon.
    man "You're Glass. I know your face."
    a "..."
    man "Sector 10. You killed my sister."
    a "I'm sorry."
    man "Sorry? SORRY? She was nine years old!"
    man "And you're SORRY?"

    # VISUAL: Crowd closing in. Multiple weapons visible. Nowhere to run.
    l "(hand on weapon) Aeron, we need to—"
    a "(stops her) Don't. We're outnumbered."
    l "Then what?"
    a "...We run. Or we die. Pick one."

    # VISUAL: Man raises weapon. Others follow. About to attack.
    # SOUND: Sudden CRACK. Gunshot. Not at them. Warning shot.

    "{i}CRACK. Gunshot. Echo. Crowd freezes.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Figure appears from alley. Hood up. Female. Armed.
    # Voice familiar. Confident. Amused.

    z "That's enough."

    # VISUAL: Crowd parts. Confused. Wary. The figure approaches.
    # SOUND: Footsteps. Deliberate. Unhurried. Commanding.

    z "These two are with me. Touch them, you answer to me."
    man "Who the hell are you?"
    z "Someone you don't want to fuck with. Now back off."

    # VISUAL: Zira lowers hood. Face revealed. Eyes sharp. Grin dangerous.
    z "Unless you want to find out what happens when you ignore me."

    # VISUAL: Man hesitates. Others uncertain. Zira's reputation precedes her.
    man "(to Aeron) This isn't over."
    "{i}Crowd disperses. Slowly. Reluctantly. But disperses.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira walks to them. Looks them over. Shakes head.
    z "You two are terrible at hiding."
    a "Zira—"
    z "Save it. Follow me. Before they change their minds."
    l "How did you know we'd be here?"
    z "(grins) I've been tracking you since you left Aeries."
    z "Did you really think you could disappear? In those clothes?"
    a "You got my message?"
    z "I got it. And I came. Because apparently you're idiots."
    z "Now move. We don't have time for gratitude."

    # VISUAL: She leads them into alley. Narrow. Dark. Hidden from main street.
    # SOUND: Their footsteps; distant crowd; her confident stride.

    "{i}She moves like she owns the place. Maybe she does.{/i}"
    "{i}We follow. Because we have no choice. Because she's right.{/i}"
    "{i}We're idiots. And we need her.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Deep in alley network. Twisting paths. Zira knows every turn.
    z "Echelon's hunting you. Whole city knows by now."
    a "Already?"
    z "Marcus put out the word. Traitors. Kill on sight. Big reward."
    z "You're famous. Congratulations."
    l "How much time do we have?"
    z "Before Echelon floods the Lower Spans? Hours. Maybe less."
    z "Before locals kill you for revenge? Minutes. Maybe less."
    z "You picked the worst possible place to hide."

    a "Where else could we go?"
    z "Anywhere but here. But too late now. You're here."
    z "So we adapt. Like always."

    # VISUAL: She stops at hidden door. Unmarked. Nondescript.
    # SOUND: Electronic lock. Beeps. Door slides open. Darkness beyond.

    z "Welcome to my safe house. It's not much. But it's yours."
    z "For now. Until we figure out what the hell you two are doing."

    # VISUAL: They enter. Door seals behind them. Darkness. Then lights flicker on.
    # LIGHTING: Dim. Industrial. Functional. Small space. Secure.

    "{i}Small. Cold. Secure. Hidden.{/i}"
    "{i}Not home. But shelter.{/i}"
    "{i}And right now, that's everything.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira tosses them water. Food packets. Basic supplies.
    z "Eat. Rest. Don't leave. I'll be back tonight."
    l "Where are you going?"
    z "To make sure you idiots stay alive."
    z "Echelon's mobilizing. Locals want blood. You're trapped."
    z "So I'm fixing it. Like I fix everything."

    a "Why are you helping us?"
    z "(pauses at door) Because I told you I would."
    z "And because 200 people are alive because Glass cracked."
    z "I want to see what happens when Glass breaks completely."
    z "(grins) Should be interesting."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door seals. They're alone.
    # SOUND: Silence. Just breathing. Exhaustion. Shock.

    "{i}Alone. Safe. For now.{/i}"
    "{i}The city hunts us. Both sides want us dead.{/i}"
    "{i}And we're here. In the dark. Waiting.{/i}"

    l "(collapses against wall) We're fucked."
    a "(sits beside her) Completely."
    l "Echelon wants us dead. Locals want us dead."
    l "We have nothing. No allies. No plan. No future."
    a "We have Zira."
    l "One person. Against a city."
    a "One person who just saved our lives."

    # VISUAL: Long silence. Both processing. Reality settling.
    "{i}Silence. Heavy. Crushing.{/i}"
    "{i}Hours ago, they witnessed 100,000 deaths.{/i}"
    "{i}Now they're fugitives. Hunted. Hated. Alone.{/i}"

    a "{i}From Glass to Ash.{/i}"
    a "{i}Burned down. Nothing left. Just fuel for fire.{/i}"
    a "{i}But fire needs more than fuel. It needs air. It needs spark.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe Zira's right. Maybe this is where we find it.{/i}"

    l "What do we do now?"
    a "We survive. One hour at a time."
    l "And after that?"
    a "...We burn them. Like we said."
    l "How? We're two people against an empire."
    a "Two people who know that empire. Who were that empire."
    a "If anyone can burn it... it's us."

    # VISUAL: They sit. Backs against wall. Exhausted. Terrified. Committed.
    "{i}Two people. One city. Impossible odds.{/i}"
    "{i}But they're here. And they're alive.{/i}"
    "{i}That's something. That has to be something.{/i}"

    # TRANSITION: Fade to black. Time passes. Night falls. Zira returns.
    # TEXT: "That Evening"

    # canon_note: Aeron & Lyra officially fugitives - hunted by both sides
    # canon_note: Zira becomes crucial lifeline - saves them immediately
    # canon_note: Lower Spans hostile - locals remember Glass, want revenge
    # canon_note: Aeron faces consequences - nephew dead, sister dead, they remember
    # canon_note: Sets up Act 2 theme: earning trust from those they harmed
    # canon_note: Aeries credits may not work in Unders - economy difference
    # canon_note: "Two people against empire" - David vs Goliath setup
    # canon_note: Zira tracking them since they left - she's been watching/helping

# =======================================================


label act2_reality_check:

    # VISUAL: Zira's safe house. Evening. Dim light. Small, cramped, functional.
    # LIGHTING: Single overhead bulb. Shadows deep. Industrial glow through window.
    # SOUND: City hum below; distant machinery; their breathing; exhaustion.

    "{i}That Evening.{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra sitting against wall. Hours passed. Exhausted. Processing.
    # Small space. Concrete walls. One window (barred). Door (locked from inside).

    "{i}Hours in the dark. Waiting. Thinking. Surviving.{/i}"
    "{i}The safe house is small. Cold. But it's shelter.{/i}"
    "{i}And shelter is everything when the world wants you dead.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron staring at nothing. Lyra checking her Band compulsively.
    # Both doing their coping mechanisms. Both barely holding together.

    a "{i}Seven hours since we left Aeries. Feels like seven years.{/i}"
    a "{i}Everything we had—gone. Everything we were—ash.{/i}"
    a "{i}And now we're here. Waiting for someone to decide if we live.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra's hand moves to Band. Touches it. Checking. Automatic.
    "{i}Her hand moves. Wrist. Band. Checking. Always checking.{/i}"
    "{i}Even here. Even now. Terrified it'll stop working.{/i}"

    l "(quiet) Do you think she's coming back?"
    a "Zira? Yeah. She said she would."
    l "People say a lot of things."
    a "She saved us. Twice. Why save us just to abandon us?"
    l "(hollow laugh) Why do anything? Nothing makes sense anymore."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Both staring at nothing. Trauma settling. Reality crushing.
    "{i}Silence. Heavy. The kind that presses on your chest.{/i}"

    a "We can't stay here forever."
    l "Where else would we go?"
    a "I don't know. But this is temporary. Zira made that clear."
    l "Then what? We just... wander the Unders hoping not to die?"
    a "We survive. Then we plan. Then we—"
    l "(cuts him off) We what, Aeron? We're two people."
    l "Echelon has thousands. Weapons. Resources. Control."
    l "What exactly do we think we're going to do?"

    # VISUAL: He looks at her. Both broken. Both questioning. Reality hitting.
    a "...I don't know. But we said we'd burn them."
    l "We said a lot of things on that rooftop."
    l "Rage. Grief. Shock. Words aren't plans."
    a "Then we make a plan."
    l "With what? We have nothing."

    # VISUAL: Aeron looks around. Small space. Minimal supplies. No resources.
    a "{i}She's right. We have nothing.{/i}"
    a "{i}No weapons. No intel. No allies. No future.{/i}"
    a "{i}Just two broken people in a concrete box.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Door lock clicking. Beeps. Opening.
    # VISUAL: Both tense. Hands move toward weapons (they don't have).

    "{i}The door opens. They freeze.{/i}"
    "{i}No weapons. Nothing but fists. And fists don't stop bullets.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira enters. Arms full of supplies. Kicks door closed behind her.
    # LIGHTING: Hallway light spills in, then cuts off. Dim bulb only source again.

    z "Still alive. Good. That's progress."

    # VISUAL: She drops supplies on floor. Food, water, clothes, basic necessities.
    # SOUND: Packages hitting concrete. Rustling. Reality of survival.

    z "Clothes. Food. Water. Fake IDs. Enough to last a few days."
    z "After that, you're on your own."

    l "Fake IDs?"
    z "You think you can walk around as yourselves?"
    z "Echelon's posted your faces everywhere. Bounty on both heads."
    z "Big bounty. Tempting bounty."

    a "How big?"
    z "50,000 credits. Each. Dead or alive."
    z "(grins) Personally, I'd take dead. Less hassle."

    # VISUAL: Both process. That much money could change lives in the Unders.
    a "{i}50,000 credits. That's a fortune down here.{/i}"
    a "{i}Everyone we meet is a potential killer. For the right price.{/i}"

    l "Why haven't you turned us in?"
    z "Because 50,000 credits spends fast. But what you represent?"
    z "That's worth more."
    a "What do we represent?"
    z "Hope. Maybe. Or a really entertaining disaster."
    z "Either way, I'm curious."

    # VISUAL: She sits. Cross-legged. Comfortable. At home here.
    z "Alright. Reality check. You two need to understand where you are."
    z "The Unders aren't Aeries. Rules are different. Culture's different."
    z "Survival's different."

    a "We know it's dangerous—"
    z "(cuts him off) You don't know shit."
    z "You ran one operation down here. One night. Escorted."
    z "That's not knowing. That's tourism."

    # VISUAL: She leans forward. Eyes sharp. Making sure they hear this.
    z "The Unders don't have Echelon law. We have our own."
    z "Barter economy. Favors. Debts. Reputation."
    z "Your Aeries credits? Worthless unless you find the right person."
    z "And finding the right person means asking. And asking means exposing yourself."

    l "What do we do for money?"
    z "You earn it. Work. Skills. Services."
    z "Or you steal it. But theft here has consequences."
    z "Not jail. Not fines. Blood. Always blood."

    # VISUAL: Both listen. Reality settling. Harsher than expected.
    a "What about allies?"
    z "Allies require trust. Trust requires time. Time requires survival."
    z "You've been here seven hours. You almost died twice."
    z "Locals hate you. Echelon's hunting you. You have no leverage."

    a "Then how do we survive?"
    z "You don't stand out. You don't talk. You don't trust anyone."
    z "You stay hidden until I say it's safe."
    z "Which might be never. So get comfortable."

    # VISUAL: Lyra picks up clothes. Plain. Worn. Nothing like Echelon.
    l "How long have you been doing this?"
    z "Doing what?"
    l "Surviving down here. Helping people. Playing both sides."
    z "(pause) Long enough to know when someone's worth the risk."

    # VISUAL: Zira stands. Moves to window. Looks out at city below.
    z "The Unders are 50 levels of humanity compressed and forgotten."
    z "Echelon looks down and sees waste. Criminals. Expendable."
    z "But we're the foundation. The city stands on us."
    z "And when we stop holding it up... it falls."

    a "Is that what you want? The city to fall?"
    z "(looks back at him) I want the people crushing us to fall."
    z "The city? The people? They're just trying to survive."
    z "Like you. Like me. Like everyone down here."

    # VISUAL: She moves to door. Preparing to leave again.

    l "Echelon's hunting us. Locals hate us. We have no money."

    l "How exactly do we survive this?"

    a "One day at a time. Like Zira said."
    l "That's not a plan."
    a "It's the only plan we have."

    # VISUAL: He picks up fake IDs. Examines them. Basic. Functional.

    a "{i}Lower Spans worker. Sector 6. Unremarkable. Forgettable.{/i}"

    l "Perfect soldier. Model citizen. Proof the system works."
    l "Now I'm... Mira Chen. Worker. Nobody. Nothing."

    a "Neither of us knows how to do this. But we're here."
    a "And as long as we're here, we're not nothing."
    l "(quiet) What are we, then?"

    # VISUAL: She leans against him. Shoulder to shoulder. Exhaustion winning.
    "{i}She leans. He doesn't move. Both too tired for anything else.{/i}"
    "{i}Two people in a concrete box. Hunted. Hated. Alone.{/i}"
    "{i}But not dead. Not yet.{/i}"

    a "I don't know."
    l "Honest answer. Thank you."
    a "We made it this far. That counts for something."

    l "Worse than today?"
    a "Always assume worse. Prepare for worse. Hope for better."
    l "(bitter laugh) You sound like a resistance fighter already."
    a "Do I?"
    l "No. You sound terrified. Like me."

    # LIGHTING: Dim bulb stays on (too dangerous to sleep in dark).
    # SOUND: City hum. Distant sirens. Their breathing. Exhaustion.

# =======================================================


label act2_safe_house_planning:

    # VISUAL: Safe house. Morning light through barred window. Day 2.
    # LIGHTING: Dim gray dawn filtering in. Single bulb still on. Cold.
    # SOUND: City waking up below; distant machinery; footsteps in hallway.

    "{i}Day 2.{/i}"
    
    # VISUAL: Aeron wakes on concrete floor. Body stiff. Lyra already awake, staring at wall.
    # Both look like hell. Dark circles. Exhaustion. Trauma settling into bones.

    "{i}Morning. If you can call it that. Concrete floor leaves you cold and aching, mind worse than the body.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Lyra glances at him. Nods. No words. What is there to say?
    l "(quiet) Did you sleep?"
    a "Some. You?"
    l "Not really."
    a "Nightmares?"
    l "Memories. Same thing at this point."

    # SOUND: Door lock beeping. Both tense immediately. Hands move toward weapons they don't have.
    "{i}The lock beeps. They freeze, hands moving instinctively toward weapons that aren't there.{/i}"
    "{i}Still defenseless. Still terrified every time that door opens.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Door opens. Zira enters. Arms full of supplies again. Looks tired but alert.
    z "Morning, fugitives. Still breathing, so that's a good start."

    # VISUAL: She drops supplies. Food packets, water, something wrapped in cloth.
    # SOUND: Packages hitting floor. Rustling. Practical.

    z "Breakfast—protein bars and water. Not fancy, but it'll keep you functional."
    a "You didn't have to—"
    z "I did, actually. You two look like corpses and I can't have you dying before the fun starts."

    # VISUAL: She sits cross-legged. Same comfortable confidence. Owns this space.
    z "Alright, reality check part two. You listening?"
    l "We're listening."
    z "Good. What I'm about to say determines whether you survive the week."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out small datapad. Lists. Notes. Plans.
    z "You can't just hide in here forever. Echelon's hunting and locals are getting suspicious. Word spreads fast down here—two Echelon operatives vanished right after the Purge."
    z "People connect dots fast in the Unders. You need cover."

    a "The fake IDs—"
    z "Are paper thin. IDs get you past casual inspection, sure. But actual survival? That requires integration. Reputation. Proof you belong here."
    z "Right now you're obvious outsiders. That makes you targets."

    l "What do we do?"
    z "You work. You blend in. You earn your place one interaction at a time."
    z "The Unders run on barter, favors, and reputation. You have exactly none of those things."
    z "So you build them. One day at a time."

    # VISUAL: She swipes through datapad. Shows them list.
    z "I've identified seven things you need to survive down here. Call them priorities. You've got about a week before Selene decides whether she'll even meet you."
    z "Use that week to prove you're serious. Prove you're not just Echelon trash hiding in a hole."

    a "What are the seven things?"

    # VISUAL: Zira leans forward. Direct. Practical. No room for negotiation.
    z "First: work. You need money—real money. Scrip that actually spends down here, not your useless Aeries credits."
    z "Your Echelon funds might work if you find the right black market dealers. But finding them means exposure. Better to earn clean."

    z "Second: weapons. You're completely unarmed right now. That's suicide in the Unders. Knife minimum, gun if you can manage it. Something to defend yourselves with."
    z "Everyone else down here is armed and they won't hesitate to use them."

    z "Third: intel. You need to know Echelon's movements and patrol patterns if you want to stay ahead of them."
    z "I have a contact—info broker. Brilliant but weird. She might help if you don't piss her off."

    z "Fourth: medical supplies. People get hurt down here constantly. You want reputation? Save someone's life. Heal someone's kid."
    z "There's an underground clinic with a medic who might help. Or might spit in your face considering Glass's reputation."

    z "Fifth: reputation itself. Do something good. Help someone. Change how people see you."
    z "Locals hate you right now. Change that one person at a time. Escort an elder, protect a vendor—small things that add up."

    z "Sixth: survival skills. You don't know the Unders. The culture, the signals, the territories. I'll teach you. Not because I'm nice, but because you're useless to anyone otherwise."

    z "Seventh: confront your past. Sector 10. The Sweep. You need to face it. There's a survivor out there—someone who remembers, someone who lost everything."
    z "Talk to them. Apologize, listen, whatever it takes. Selene will ask, and if you haven't done it she'll know you're not serious."

    # VISUAL: Both process. Seven tasks. One week. Overwhelming.
    l "That's... a lot."
    z "That's survival. You wanted to fight Echelon? This is step one. You can't fight an empire from a concrete box."
    z "You need allies, resources, skills, trust. None of that comes free."

    a "What about Selene? You said she's considering."
    z "She is. Barely. I told her about the Sweep and the 200 you saved. She didn't shoot the messenger, so that's progress."
    z "But she lost most of her cell in the Purge. Sector 10 was her territory. You swept Sector 10, which means you killed her people."
    z "So yeah, she's considering. Considering whether to meet you or just put a bullet in your head the moment she sees you."

    l "Will she help us?"
    z "Depends. Do these seven things. Prove you're not just hiding. Prove you're willing to work, to change, to actually earn it."
    z "Then maybe she gives you a chance. Or maybe she kills you anyway. Honestly could go either way."

    # VISUAL: Zira stands. Stretches. Ready to leave again.
    z "You've got one week. Seven days, seven tasks. Do them in whatever order you want—I don't care. But get them done. All of them."
    z "Because when Selene agrees to meet, you better have something to show for this week."

    a "Where do we start?"
    z "That's up to you. You're adults. Figure it out."
    z "Just don't do anything stupid. Which, given your track record, is probably a lot to ask."

    # VISUAL: She moves to door. Pauses. Looks back.
    z "I'll check in and leave messages when I can. Help where it makes sense. But I can't babysit. I have my own work, my own problems."
    z "You're on your own most of the time. Get used to it."

    l "Zira. Why are you doing this?"
    z "(pauses) Because someone should. And nobody else will."
    z "And because... I want to see if Glass can become something else. Call it curiosity, call it hope, call it stupidity."
    z "Either way, don't waste it."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door closes. Lock engages. Alone again.
    "{i}Gone again. Leaving them with seven impossible tasks and one week to complete them.{/i}"
    "{i}Everything rides on this. Every single thing.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Both sit. Looking at each other. Overwhelmed but determined.
    l "Seven tasks."
    a "Seven days."
    l "Where do we even start?"
    a "...I don't know. But we have to start somewhere."

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands. Looks at door. The city beyond. Terrifying and necessary.
    a "{i}One week to prove we're worth keeping alive. One week to build something from nothing.{/i}"
    a "{i}Seven tasks. Every single one could kill us.{/i}"

    l "(stands beside him) We do this together. Like everything else."
    a "Together. Yeah."
    l "What's first?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron looks at her. Both broken. Both scared. Both committed.
    a "We figure out who Kade Voss is. Who Mira Chen is. We go out there, we survive, we earn it."
    l "One day at a time."
    a "One day at a time."

            a "I'm not trying to complicate things—"
            n "Then provide context. Or don't—but understand that I calculate risk continuously."
            n "Unknown variables increase uncertainty. Uncertainty decreases my willingness to share high-value intelligence."
            
            # VISUAL: She doesn't seem hurt. Just... calculating. Adjusting probability.
            n "I'll share limited data—surface-level analysis only until you prove reliable."
            n "If you demonstrate consistent accuracy and non-hostile intent, I'll increase information sharing accordingly."
            n "Basic trust protocol. Does that work for you?"

    # VISUAL: Either way, she extends datapad. Offering some level of partnership.
    a "Acceptable. And... thank you."
    n "Gratitude is unnecessary for transactional exchanges, but acknowledged anyway. You're welcome."

    # VISUAL: She transfers data to his datapad. Files flowing. Advanced intel.
    # SOUND: Electronic beeps. Data transfer. His pad suddenly much more useful.

    "{i}Her data fills my datapad—charts, models, predictions, analysis.{/i}"
    "{i}More intelligence than I could gather in months. She's sharing it in seconds.{/i}"

    a "This is extensive. You're sure you want to share all this?"
    n "Information hoarded is information wasted. Resistance requires distributed knowledge and redundant data storage."
    n "Also, if you die with this data, I have backups in three separate locations. Risk mitigation."

    # VISUAL: He can't tell if she's joking. Her face: completely neutral.
    a "Right. Risk mitigation."
    n "Was that intended as humor? I detected possible sarcasm but remain uncertain."
    a "Honestly, I don't know either."
    n "Acceptable answer. Ambiguity acknowledged. Moving forward."

    # VISUAL: She moves to rooftop edge. Looks down at patrols. Observing.
    n "Next patrol arrives in approximately 4 minutes. Route designation Alpha-7. Confidence level: 94%."
    n "We'll observe together, verify my model's accuracy, and I'll adjust variables if the prediction fails."

    # VISUAL: They stand side by side. Watching. Waiting. Silence comfortable (for her).
    "{i}She doesn't fill silence with unnecessary words. Doesn't perform socially. Just exists.{/i}"
    "{i}Watching data transform into reality. Equations becoming patrols.{/i}"

    # SOUND: Patrol approaches below. Boots. Voices. Echelon soldiers.
    # VISUAL: Exactly on schedule. Exactly the route she predicted.

    n "Route Alpha-7, exactly as predicted. Model accuracy confirmed."
    n "(small note of satisfaction) Good. I really dislike being wrong."

    a "You do this every night? Predict their movements?"
    n "Daily, yes. Predictive modeling has a calming effect on me—there's something deeply satisfying about finding order within apparent chaos."
    n "It's also functionally useful for survival since avoiding Echelon requires knowing where they'll be before they arrive."

    a "How long have you been down here living underground?"
    n "Six months, three weeks, and two days since I left Compliance Division."
    n "My survival rate has exceeded initial projections, which suggests successful environmental adaptation."
    n "(slight pause) Though I do miss reliable data infrastructure and climate-controlled environments."

    # VISUAL: She says it matter-of-fact. Missing climate control = missing family.
    a "{i}She misses climate control, not people or comfort. Climate control.{/i}"
    a "{i}I can't tell if that's sad or just... her. Just how her mind works.{/i}"

    a "Do you work with others or primarily solo?"
    n "Primarily solo. Social interaction requires significant energy that I prefer allocating toward research and analysis."
    n "But I maintain a small network of contacts—information sources, occasional collaborators. People I can work with on specific projects."
    n "(gestures between them) This qualifies as one. Mutually beneficial and surprisingly tolerable so far."

    a "Tolerable. That's high praise."
    n "(brief glance at him) You haven't annoyed me yet, which is statistically rare. Most people become irritating within the first ten minutes."
    n "You're currently at 15 minutes with minimal irritation. That's promising."

    # VISUAL: They watch patrols disappear. Silence returns. She prepares to leave.
    n "I have sufficient observational data for tonight. I'm returning to run full analysis on the variables."
    n "(transfers coordinates to his pad) Meet me here tomorrow at 23:00. Different location, same purpose. Try not to be late."

    a "What if I can't make it?"
    n "Then I work alone as usual, which I'm accustomed to."
    n "(slight pause) But I'd prefer you attend. Your field observations improve my predictive accuracy by 12 to 18 percent, which is statistically significant enough to justify continued collaboration."

    # VISUAL: She turns to leave. Stops. Looks back. Almost uncertain (rare for her).
    n "Kade. One question before I go."
    a "Yeah?"
    n "Why defect specifically? What was the variable that shifted you from compliance to resistance?"

    # VISUAL: He processes. How to explain the Purge? The guilt? The shattering?
    a "I watched 100,000 people die in minutes because of decisions I made."
    a "And I realized I couldn't be part of that system anymore."

    n "(long pause, processing carefully) Causal guilt combined with ethical crisis. Your entire identity structure fractured when your actions contradicted your core values."
    n "(quieter, more careful) That's... logical. Extremely painful, but logically consistent."
    n "I'm sorry for what you're experiencing. Even though logically, expressing regret doesn't change past events or reduce your pain."

    # VISUAL: She says it awkwardly. Like practicing a skill she's studied but not mastered.
    a "Thank you. I think."
    n "I'm not particularly skilled at emotional responses. They don't come naturally to me."
    n "But the research data suggests empathy improves cooperative relationships, so I'm attempting it."
    n "(slight uncertainty) Was that adequate?"

    a "(small smile) You're doing fine."
    n "(nods once) Noted. I'll continue making attempts then."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Disappears into shadows. Gone as suddenly as she appeared.
    "{i}And just like that she's gone, like she was never here at all.{/i}"
    "{i}But my datapad is full of her work—models, predictions, brilliant analysis.{/i}"

    a "{i}Noelle Korr. Analyst. Former Compliance Division researcher.{/i}"
    a "{i}Blunt, clinical, brilliant, and unexpectedly human beneath all that logic.{/i}"
    a "{i}And somehow I think I just made an ally.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He reviews her data. Page after page. Intricate. Beautiful in its logic.
    a "{i}She sees the world in patterns, algorithms, probabilities.{/i}"
    a "{i}No performance, no masks, no social games. Just unfiltered truth.{/i}"
    a "{i}It's strange and uncomfortable, but there's something honest about it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe that's what I need right now. Someone who can't lie even if she wanted to.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira examining the data Noelle provided. Impressed.
    z "Where the hell did you get this? This is professional-grade intelligence analysis."
    a "Met someone tonight. An analyst who's been tracking Echelon independently."
    z "She? What's her name?"
    a "Noelle Korr. Says she used to work for Compliance Division."

    # VISUAL: Zira stops. Looks up sharp. Recognizes the name immediately.
    z "(low whistle) Noelle Korr. I've heard of her."
    z "Neural conditioning researcher. Absolutely brilliant. She disappeared from Echelon about six months ago."
    z "Word is she stole massive amounts of classified research data. They've been hunting her ever since."

    a "She mentioned discovering ethical violations. Memory alteration programs."
    z "Yeah. She found proof that Echelon was literally rewriting people's memories to maintain compliance."
    z "Erasing dissent at the neurological level. She tried to expose it internally, and they tried to erase her."
    z "(grins) But she got out with her research intact. And now she's working with you."

    a "Is that a problem?"
    z "Problem? Glass, you just partnered with one of the most wanted defectors in Solveil."
    z "(looks at data again) This is incredibly valuable. Keep working with her."
    z "She's probably the smartest person in this entire city, and if she's willing to share intel with you, don't fuck it up."

    a "She wants to meet again tomorrow night. Same arrangement."
    z "Go. Learn everything she'll teach you. This kind of predictive analysis could save dozens of lives."
    z "(serious now) But be careful. She's Echelon's second-most-wanted target after you."
    z "If they find you together, they'll kill both of you without hesitation."

    a "Understood."
    z "Good. Now get some rest. Tomorrow's another day of not dying, and apparently you have a date with a genius."

# =======================================================


label activity_medical_supplies:

    # VISUAL: Lower Spans. Day. Sector 7. Hidden alley leading to underground clinic.
    # LIGHTING: Dim natural light filtered through grates above. Warm amber glow from clinic entrance.
    # SOUND: Distant city hum; voices murmuring; someone crying softly; life struggling.

    scene bg_sector7_alley with fade

    "{i}Day 4. Activity: Medical Supplies.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said find a medic. Someone who can patch us up when things go wrong.{/i}"
    "{i}Because things will go wrong. They always do.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron following directions. Alley narrows. Graffiti on walls. Signs of life.
    "{i}The address Zira gave me leads here. Sector 7. Deep in the Unders.{/i}"
    "{i}A clinic. Hidden. For people who can't afford Echelon's sanitized medicine.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Entrance marked with faded green symbol. Hand-painted. Medical cross.
    # SOUND: Voices inside. Someone groaning in pain. Someone speaking softly, gently.

    a "{i}Green mark. Medical cross. This is it.{/i}"
    a "{i}Zira said her name is Tessa. Runs a scavenger-care commune.{/i}"
    a "{i}Hybrid medicine. Organic and cybernetic. Whatever keeps people alive.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He pushes through hanging cloth serving as door. Enters clinic.
    # LIGHTING: Warm amber-green glow. Bioluminescent plants growing in corners. Soft, alive.
    # SOUND: Quiet. Reverent almost. People resting. Breathing. Healing.

    scene bg_tessas_clinic with fade

    "{i}The clinic smells like herbs and antiseptic mixed together. Life trying to survive.{/i}"
    "{i}Makeshift beds line the walls. Injured people resting. Burns. Wounds. Sickness.{/i}"
    "{i}And in the center, kneeling beside a man with severe burns—her.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa. Mid-20s. Dark hair tied back. Gentle hands glowing faint green.
    # She's applying bioluminescent gel to burn victim. Speaking softly. Calming.
    # LIGHTING: Green glow from her hands. Organic compound. Healing made visible.

    t "(soft, rhythmic) Breathe. That's all I'm asking right now. Just breathe with me."
    t "In through your nose. Hold it. Out through your mouth."
    t "Good. You're doing so well. I know it hurts, but you're here. You're alive."

    # VISUAL: Burn victim (male, 40s) trembling. Tears streaming. But breathing.
    "{i}His skin is charred black in places. Red and weeping in others. Purge victim.{/i}"
    "{i}She works with steady hands. No hesitation. No revulsion. Just care.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands at entrance. Watching. Something in his chest tightens.
    a "{i}She's healing someone I helped create. My mercy triggered the Purge.{/i}"
    a "{i}These burns exist because I saved 200 people. Cascade of consequences.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa looks up. Eyes meet his. Recognition immediate and complete.
    # Her hands don't stop working. Gel continues spreading. Patient comes first.

    t "(quiet, not stopping) You're Glass."

    # VISUAL: Injured man's eyes snap open. Others in clinic turn. Tension spikes instantly.
    # SOUND: Breathing changes. Fear. Anger. Recognition spreading like wildfire.

    "{i}The name echoes in the small space. Glass. Everyone knows Glass.{/i}"
    "{i}Everyone lost someone to Glass. Sector 10. The Sweep. 600 dead.{/i}"

    a "...Yes."

    # VISUAL: Tessa returns focus to patient. Doesn't look at Aeron. Keeps working.
    t "(to patient) It's alright. Stay still. I'm almost finished."
    t "(to Aeron, calm) Why are you here?"

    a "I need medical supplies. Someone said you—"
    t "I know what you need. I asked why you're here."
    t "(still not looking at him) In the Unders. Alive. When Echelon should be hunting you."

    # VISUAL: She finishes applying gel. Bandages the burns carefully. Tender and precise.
    t "(to patient) There. The gel will keep working for the next six hours. You'll feel it cooling."
    t "Rest now. I'll check on you in an hour."

    # VISUAL: Patient nods weakly. Looks at Aeron with mix of fear and hatred. Says nothing.
    # Tessa stands. Turns fully toward Aeron. Studies him. Not with hate. With sadness.

    t "You caused this. The Purge. These injuries. These deaths."
    a "I didn't—"
    t "Your actions triggered it. That's causation enough, even if you didn't light the fires yourself."

    # VISUAL: She walks to sink. Washes hands. Methodical. Centered. Processing.
    "{i}She's calm. Too calm. Like she's decided something already.{/i}"
    "{i}Judgment rendered before I even explained.{/i}"

    a "I'm not asking for forgiveness—"
    t "(turns, looks at him fully) Then what are you asking for?"

    # VISUAL: Long pause. What IS he asking for? Supplies? Absolution? A reason to keep going?
    a "...Help. I need help to keep fighting."
    t "Fighting who? Echelon? Or yourself?"

    # VISUAL: The question lands like a blade. Clean. Precise. True.
    a "{i}Herself? Both? I don't even know anymore.{/i}"

    t "(softer now) Why are you here, Aeron? In the Unders. Away from everything you knew."
    t "You could have stayed in Aeries. Stayed Glass. Stayed safe."
    t "But you didn't. Why?"

    a "Because I watched 100,000 people die and I couldn't be part of that system anymore."
    a "Because I'm trying to fix what I broke. Even if I can't. Even if it kills me."

    # VISUAL: She studies him. Eyes deep and warm and infinitely sad. Measuring truth.
    t "You can't fix 100,000 dead, Aeron. You can't patch souls with medicine."
    t "But you can help the living. If that's truly what you want."

    # VISUAL: She moves to cabinet. Opens it. Pulls out medkit. Well-stocked. Organized.
    # Places it on table between them. Offering. Testing.

    t "I'm Tessa Kael. I heal people. All people. Even those who don't deserve it."
    t "(looks at him directly) Which means you too. Despite everything."

    a "Why?"
    t "Because mercy isn't about deserving. It's about choosing."
    t "And I choose to believe you're here for the right reasons."
    t "(slight pause) Prove me right. Or prove me a fool. Either way, I'll have tried."

    # VISUAL: She pushes medkit toward him. Not freely given. Offered with expectation.
    a "{i}She's not forgiving me. She's giving me a chance.{/i}"
    a "{i}Burden of proof. Earn it through action.{/i}"

    a "I don't know if I deserve this chance."
    t "Probably not. But that's not for me to judge."
    t "I heal. You fight. We both serve life in different ways."
    t "(gentle but firm) Take the medkit. Use it to save someone. Then come back."
    t "Show me Glass can do more than cut."

    # VISUAL: He takes medkit. Heavy. Not just weight. Responsibility. Expectation.
    a "Thank you."
    t "Don't thank me yet. Gratitude means nothing until you've earned it."
    t "Actions first. Words after."

    # VISUAL: He turns to leave. Stops. Looks back at burn victim. At others resting.
    a "These people. The burn victims. They're from the Purge?"
    t "Most of them, yes. Survivors from Sectors 8, 9, and 10."
    t "The ones who made it out. Barely."

    a "How many?"
    t "In my clinic right now? Fourteen. In all of Sector 7? Maybe a hundred."
    t "(quiet) Out of 100,000. That's the survival rate."

    # VISUAL: Numbers crushing him. 100,000 dead. 100 survived. Because of his mercy.
    a "{i}My mercy killed 99,900 people.{/i}"
    a "{i}The arithmetic of guilt. It never balances.{/i}"

    t "You're calculating, aren't you? How many died because of you."
    a "How did you—"
    t "I see it in your face. The weight. The math."
    t "(steps closer) Stop counting the dead, Aeron. Start counting the living."
    t "You can't bring back 100,000. But you can save the next hundred."
    t "That's how you fix it. One person at a time. Forever."

    # VISUAL: She says it simply. Like it's obvious. Like redemption is just arithmetic.
    a "That's... a long time."
    t "Yes. It is."
    t "(small sad smile) But you're here. Which means you're willing to try."
    t "That's more than most people manage."

    # VISUAL: Someone calls from across clinic. Another patient needs attention.
    voice "Tessa? I need help over here."

    t "Coming!"
    t "(to Aeron) I have to go. People need me."
    t "(hands him second medkit) Take this too. You'll need more than one."
    t "And Aeron? Come back when you've used them. I want to know who you saved."

    a "You want me to report back?"
    t "I want you to remember their names. The people you save."
    t "(firm) Because Glass killed 600 people. I want to know how many Aeron saves."
    t "Keep count. It matters."

    # VISUAL: She walks away. Returns to patients. Hands glowing green again. Life continuing.
    "{i}She didn't forgive me. Didn't absolve me. Didn't make it easier.{/i}"
    "{i}She just gave me work to do. People to save. A way forward.{/i}"
    "{i}Maybe that's better than forgiveness. Maybe that's what I need.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He looks at medkits. Two of them. Heavy with expectation.
    a "{i}Keep count, she said. Remember their names.{/i}"
    a "{i}600 dead. How many living to balance that?{/i}"
    a "{i}Infinite, probably. But I have to start somewhere.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He turns to leave. Stops at doorway. Looks back one more time.
    # Tessa kneeling beside another patient. Green glow surrounding her hands. Healing.

    a "{i}Tessa Kael. Healer. Heart of the Unders.{/i}"
    a "{i}She sees the worst humanity has to offer and chooses compassion anyway.{/i}"
    a "{i}Glass killed. Tessa heals.{/i}"
    a "{i}Maybe that's who I need to learn from.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira sees the medkits. Raises eyebrow. Impressed.
    z "Two medkits? She must like you."
    a "She doesn't like me. She's testing me."
    z "Same thing with Tessa. She only tests people she thinks are worth saving."
    z "(grins) Told you to find a medic. Didn't expect you'd find the best one in the Unders."

    a "She knew who I was. Immediately."
    z "Everyone knows who you are, Glass. You're famous down here."
    z "But Tessa doesn't work in hate. She works in hope."
    z "If she gave you medkits, she's hoping you'll prove her right."

    a "She said to come back. After I've used them. Tell her who I saved."
    z "(softens) That sounds like Tessa. She collects names. Remembers everyone she heals."
    z "Says it matters. That people deserve to be remembered."

    # VISUAL: Aeron looks at medkits. Responsibility weighing.
    a "What if I can't save anyone? What if I just make things worse?"
    z "Then you try again. That's what Tessa does. Every day."
    z "She loses patients. She loses people she cares about. But she keeps trying."
    z "(firm) That's what separates people like her from people like Echelon."
    z "Echelon stops trying. Tessa never does."

    a "She's... different. From anyone I've met."
    z "She's the best of us. Proof that kindness can survive even here."
    z "Learn from her. Let her teach you how to save people instead of killing them."
    z "(slight smile) Might be good for your soul. If you still have one."

    a "I'm not sure I do."
    z "Then let Tessa help you grow a new one. She's good at that."

    "{i}Day 5. Activity: Survival Skills.{/i}"
    "{i}Zira said I need to learn how to actually survive down here.{/i}"
    "{i}Not just hide. Survive. Blend in. Become invisible.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Zira sitting cross-legged on floor. Spread of items before her.
    # Clothing, tools, maps, markers. Teaching materials.

    z "Alright, Glass. Time for your education in not being a walking Echelon advertisement."
    z "Sit down. Pay attention. This might keep you alive."

    # VISUAL: Aeron sits across from her. Tired but attentive. Five days of activities wearing on him.
    a "What am I learning today?"
    z "How to be nobody. How to move through the Unders without screaming 'I'm from Aeries, please murder me.'"
    z "Clothing, speech patterns, body language, cultural markers. Everything that separates us from them."

    # VISUAL: She pushes bundle of clothes toward him. Worn. Local. Unders style.
    z "First: you dress like you belong. No clean lines. No military posture in civilian clothes."
    z "Wear this. Look like you've lived here your whole life."

    # VISUAL: He examines clothes. Rough fabric. Stained but functional. Real.
    a "These are... used."
    z "Of course they're used. Nobody down here has new anything."
    z "New clothes mean you stole them or you're Echelon. Both get you killed."
    z "(pushes them) Change. Now. I need to see how you move in them."

    # VISUAL: He changes (off screen). Returns wearing Unders clothing. Feels wrong.
    # LIGHTING: He looks different. Rougher. More real. Less Glass.

    z "(circles him, examining) Better. You look human now instead of weapon-shaped."
    z "But you're still moving wrong. Too precise. Too controlled."
    z "Unders don't move like soldiers. We slouch. We shuffle. We conserve energy."

    # VISUAL: She demonstrates. Her posture shifts. Less confident. More tired. Real.
    z "See? I'm not Zira the rogue anymore. I'm just another worker going home."
    z "Invisible. Forgettable. That's how you survive."

    # VISUAL: Aeron tries to copy. Awkward at first. Too deliberate.
    a "(attempting slouch) Like this?"
    z "No, you look like you're injured. Relax. Let gravity win."
    z "You've been fighting gravity your whole life. Stop fighting. Just exist."

    # VISUAL: He tries again. Better. More natural. She nods approval.
    z "There. That's better. You look tired instead of dangerous."
    z "Tired is good. Tired is normal. Everyone down here is tired."

    # VISUAL: She sits again. Pulls out hand-drawn maps. Territory markers.
    z "Next: territories. The Unders aren't unified. They're fractured into districts, each controlled by different groups."
    z "You need to know who owns what. Where you're safe. Where you're dead."

    # VISUAL: She traces routes on map. Markers. Symbols. Complex web.
    z "Red marks: hostile territory. Stay out unless you want problems."
    z "Green marks: neutral zones. Markets, clinics, public spaces. Safe-ish."
    z "Blue marks: friendly contacts. People I know. Use my name carefully."

    a "How do I know which territory I'm in?"
    z "Graffiti. Tags. Colors. Each group marks their space."
    z "(points to map) See this? Three vertical lines. That's the Rust Collective. Hard people, but fair."
    z "This one? Circle with a dot. The Underlows. Avoid them. They hate Echelon more than most."

    # VISUAL: Aeron studies map. Memorizing. Taking it seriously.
    a "Why are you teaching me this? You could've just given me the map."
    z "Because maps don't teach survival. Experience does."
    z "And I don't have time to save your ass every time you wander into wrong territory."
    z "(slight pause) Also... I need you to survive. For what's coming."

    # VISUAL: Something in her tone. Heavier. More personal. He notices.
    a "What's coming?"
    z "War. Eventually. If we're lucky."
    z "If we're not lucky? Echelon crushes what's left of resistance and we all die anyway."
    z "Either way, I need you ready. Can't have you dying because you didn't know a gang sign."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out small notebook. Worn. Personal. Hesitates before opening.
    z "There's one more thing you need to learn. Language."
    z "Not just words. Hand signals. Code phrases. Ways to communicate without speaking."

    # VISUAL: She demonstrates hand signals. Quick. Precise. Military-esque but different.
    z "This means 'danger.' This means 'move.' This means 'Echelon nearby.'"
    z "These kept resistance alive before the Purge. Some still use them."

    # VISUAL: Aeron copies signals. Muscle memory activating. Learns quickly.
    a "These are... old military signals. Modified."
    z "Smart boy. Yeah, they're adapted from old resistance codes."
    z "My brother taught me these. Before..."
    "{i}She stops. Cuts off. Didn't mean to mention that.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron notices. Carefully approaches the opening she left.
    a "Brother?"
    z "(tense) Forget I said that."
    a "Zira—"
    z "Drop it, Glass. We're here to teach you survival, not excavate my past."

    # VISUAL: Silence. Heavy. She's guarded now. Walls up. But something's cracking.
    "{i}She's hiding something. Something painful. Something that explains her.{/i}"

            z "(jaw tight) I said drop it."
            a "And I'm saying you don't have to carry it alone."
            a "You've saved my life twice. Taught me how to survive. Given me everything."
            a "Let me know who I'm surviving for. Why you're doing this."
            
            # VISUAL: She stares at him. Measuring. Debating. Then something breaks.
            z "(long exhale) ...Kai. His name was Kai."

            # VISUAL: She looks at him. Brief surprise. Then nods. Appreciates the space.
            z "Smart. Don't push. I respect that."
            z "(demonstrates signal) This one means—"
            
            # VISUAL: She stops mid-gesture. Looks at notebook. At hand signals.
            # Something in her cracks anyway. Can't keep it in.
            
            z "(quiet) His name was Kai. My brother."
            z "He taught me these signals. Before Echelon killed him."

    # VISUAL: The room temperature drops. Truth laid bare. Painful and raw.
    # SOUND: City hum fades. Just her breathing. Just this moment.

    "{i}Kai. Her brother. Dead.{/i}"
    "{i}Everything she's done suddenly makes sense.{/i}"

    a "(quiet) What happened?"
    z "(stares at notebook) He tried to defect. Like you. Four years ago."
    z "He was Echelon too. Mid-level operative. Nothing special. Just another weapon."
    z "But he had a conscience. Started questioning orders. Seeing what they really were."

    # VISUAL: She traces hand signals in notebook. Memorizing. Remembering.
    z "He came to me. Said he couldn't do it anymore. Needed help getting out."
    z "I was already underground by then. Rogue. Surviving on my own."
    z "I told him I'd help him. Get him out. Find him a new life in the Unders."

    # VISUAL: Her jaw clenches. Painful memory surfacing. She forces it out.
    z "We planned it for weeks. Every detail. Every contingency. I thought we had it perfect."
    z "(bitter laugh) We didn't account for Marcus Rylan."

    # VISUAL: Aeron goes still. Father's name like ice water. Always his father.
    a "Marcus... knew?"
    z "Marcus knows everything. That's his gift. Omniscient bastard."
    z "Kai made it three blocks from Echelon HQ before they caught him."
    z "Not patrol. Not guards. Marcus himself. Waiting."

    # VISUAL: She closes notebook. Hands shaking slightly. Controlled fury.
    z "Marcus gave him a choice. Return to service, or face execution for treason."
    z "Kai chose execution. Said he'd rather die free than live as Glass."
    z "(voice breaking slightly) Marcus shot him personally. Made example of him."
    z "Broadcasted it. 'This is what happens to traitors. This is Echelon's mercy.'"

    # VISUAL: Aeron's stomach drops. Father's cruelty familiar but still devastating.
    a "{i}Father killed her brother. Made it public. Made it terror.{/i}"
    a "{i}Four years ago. I was eighteen. Still Glass. Still obedient.{/i}"
    a "{i}Did I see that broadcast? Did I watch her brother die and feel nothing?{/i}"

    a "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Zira."
    z "Don't apologize for your father. You didn't pull the trigger."
    z "(looks at him) But you're him. Same escape attempt. Same conscience emerging."
    z "That's why I'm helping you. You're Kai's second chance."

    # VISUAL: Truth settles. Her motivation crystal clear. Redemption proxy.
    a "I'm not your brother."
    z "I know you're not. But you're close enough."
    z "When I saw you crack—when Glass started breaking—I saw Kai again."
    z "Same look in your eyes. Same realization that the system is rot."
    z "And I thought... maybe this time it works. Maybe this time he gets out."

    # VISUAL: She stands. Paces. Energy needing release. Emotion too strong.
    z "I told myself I wouldn't care. That you were just another asset. Another tool."
    z "But I do care. And that's fucking terrifying."
    z "Because if you die... it's like watching Kai die again."

    # VISUAL: Aeron stands. Approaches carefully. She's coiled tight. Vulnerable and dangerous.
    a "I'm not going to die."
    z "(bitter laugh) That's what Kai said. Right before Marcus put a bullet in his head."
    a "I'm not Kai. And I'm not going to let Marcus win again."
    z "You don't know that. Nobody knows that."
    z "Echelon always wins. That's what they do. They crush hope and call it order."

    # VISUAL: He moves closer. Not touching. Just present. Grounding.
    a "Then we change the pattern. We make Echelon lose."
    a "For Kai. For everyone Marcus killed. For everyone we can still save."
    z "(looks at him, eyes wet but fierce) You really believe that? That we can win?"
    a "I have to. Because if I don't believe it, what's the point of any of this?"

    # VISUAL: She stares at him. Measuring. Then something shifts. Decision made.
    z "(reaches into jacket pocket) I have something for you."
    z "Something I've been carrying for four years. Something Kai wanted me to have."

    # VISUAL: She pulls out device. Small. Technical. Advanced. Hacking tool.
    # LIGHTING: Faint blue glow. Precious. Irreplaceable.

    z "Hacking device. Military-grade. One of a kind. Kai built it himself."
    z "Can bypass Echelon security protocols. Slice through encrypted systems."
    z "He was carrying it when they killed him. I recovered it after... after the execution."

    # VISUAL: She holds it out. Offering. Painful to give away but necessary.
    z "I want you to have it. Use it to do what Kai couldn't."
    z "Burn Echelon from the inside. Make Marcus pay."

    # VISUAL: Aeron takes it carefully. Reverent. Understanding the weight.
    a "Zira, I can't take this. It's—"
    z "It's a tool. And tools are meant to be used, not worshipped."
    z "Kai would want someone to finish his work. Might as well be you."
    z "(firm) Take it. Honor him by destroying the thing that killed him."

    # VISUAL: He closes hand around device. Acceptance and responsibility.
    a "I will. I promise."
    z "Don't promise. Just do it."
    z "(slight pause) And Glass? Don't die. I can't watch that twice."

    # VISUAL: Their eyes meet. Understanding. She's not just helping him. She's saving herself.
    a "I won't die. I'm too stubborn."
    z "(small smile) Good. Stubbornness might be what saves you."
    z "Kai was stubborn too. Just not stubborn enough."

    # VISUAL: She turns away. Wipes eyes quickly. Composing herself. Walls returning.
    z "(back to business) Alright. Enough feelings. Back to survival."
    z "You know the territories. You know the signals. You know why I'm invested."
    z "Now you need to practice. Tomorrow you're going out alone."

    a "Alone?"
    z "Can't hold your hand forever. You need to learn to move through the Unders independently."
    z "I'll track you. Make sure you don't die. But you're on your own."
    z "(slight grin) Try not to get murdered on your first solo trip."

    # VISUAL: Despite everything, he almost laughs. Her humor cutting through weight.
    a "I'll do my best."
    z "Your best better be good enough."

    # VISUAL: She gathers teaching materials. Packs them away. Preparing to leave.
    z "Get some rest. Tomorrow's going to be interesting."
    z "(at door, looks back) And Glass? Thanks. For listening. For... caring."
    z "Most people don't bother asking about the dead. Easier to ignore ghosts."

    a "Kai isn't a ghost. Not while we remember him."
    z "(soft smile) No. I suppose he isn't."
    z "Goodnight, Aeron. Sleep if you can."

    # VISUAL: She leaves. Door closes. He's alone with Kai's device and new understanding.
    "{i}Zira the rogue. Zira the survivor. Zira the sister.{/i}"
    "{i}She's not helping me out of belief or ideology.{/i}"
    "{i}She's helping me because I'm her second chance. Her do-over. Her hope.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: He examines hacking device. Blue glow. Kai's legacy.
    a "{i}Four years ago, Marcus killed her brother for trying to escape.{/i}"
    a "{i}Now I'm trying to escape. And she's making sure I succeed.{/i}"
    a "{i}Kai's second chance. That's a lot of weight to carry.{/i}"
    a "{i}But if it means Zira gets her closure... I'll carry it.{/i}"

    a "{i}For Kai. For Zira. For everyone Marcus destroyed.{/i}"
    a "{i}We're going to burn Echelon down. And Marcus with it.{/i}"
    a "{i}That's not a promise. That's a guarantee.{/i}"
