# =======================================================


label act2_tessa_mercy_death:

    # VISUAL: Base. Medical station. Three days after recruitment scene. Night. Quiet. One patient. Critical.
    # LIGHTING: Dim. Surgical lights focused on single bed. Shadows deep. Oppressive.
    # SOUND: Labored breathing. Medical equipment beeping. Slow. Failing. Dying.

    scene bg_medical_station_critical with fade

    "{i}Medical station. Night. Three days since we hit 587 fighters. Three days since Noelle's countdown started. Eleven days left until probable Echelon discovery. But right now? Right now there's just one person. One fighter. One name. Dying. And nothing we can do to stop it.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: TESSA at bedside. Exhausted. Hands bloody. Been working for hours. Trying. Failing. Knowing it.

    "{i}Tessa's been here for six hours. Trying everything. Every technique. Every medication. Every procedure. Nothing working. Patient's dying. Slowly. Painfully. Inevitably. And she knows it. Can see it in her face. In her hands. In the way she's stopped moving. Just standing. Just watching. Just witnessing death she can't prevent.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: PATIENT on bed. Young man. Early twenties. Named MARCUS (ironic, painful name). Training accident three days ago. Sparring went wrong. Internal bleeding. Infection set in. Sepsis spreading. Dying.

    "{i}Torin. Young. Twenty-two. Joined two weeks ago. Enthusiastic. Dedicated. Good fighter. Then training accident. Sparring partner's strike landed wrong. Internal damage. Tried to treat it. Infection anyway. Sepsis. Spreading. Killing him. Three days of trying. Three days of failing. Now just watching. Waiting. Witnessing.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Torin breathing. Labored. Painful. Conscious. Aware. Suffering. Begging with eyes.

    torin "(weak, gasping) Tessa... how long?"

    # VISUAL: Tessa's face. Professional mask cracking. Grief showing. Truth unavoidable.

    t "Hours. Maybe day. Not more. The infection spread too far. We don't have antibiotics strong enough. We don't have surgical equipment adequate for internal repair. We don't have... we don't have what you need. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

    # VISUAL: Torin processing. Death sentence. But relief too. End in sight. End to suffering.

    torin "Hours. Okay. That's... that's better than days. Days would be worse. Days of this. This pain. This breathing. This... existing. Hours is better."

    # VISUAL: Pause. Labored breathing. Then question. Quiet. Desperate. Necessary.

    torin "Can you... can you make it faster? Make it stop? I don't want hours. I don't want to feel this anymore. Can you make it stop? Please?"

    # VISUAL: Tessa freezing. The question. The impossible question. The mercy question. Assisted death. Murder. Compassion. Sin. Salvation. All at once.

    "{i}He's asking. The question. The one that destroys everything. Can you make it stop? Can you kill me? Can you end this suffering? That's not medical question. That's moral question. That's philosophical question. That's impossible question. And she has to answer. Has to choose. Has to decide if mercy means healing or mercy means ending. And there's no right answer. Just less wrong ones.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa's hands shaking. Professional composure breaking. This is the nightmare. The scenario. The choice.

    t "Torin... what you're asking... that's not healing. That's ending. That's me becoming what I hate. That's me killing instead of saving. I can't... I don't..."

    # VISUAL: Torin's hand reaching. Weak. Touching hers. Human connection. Desperate plea.

    torin "You're not killing. You're stopping suffering. That's different. That's mercy. Please. I'm begging. I don't want to die slow. Don't want hours of this. Just... just let me go. Let me stop. Please."

    # VISUAL: Tessa crying. Silent tears. Professional mask gone. Just human. Just broken. Just facing impossible.

    t "I count the living. That's what I do. That's my purpose. I save people. I heal people. I make the count go up. Not down. Never down. If I do this... if I end you... the count goes down. That's wrong. That's failure. That's everything I'm against."

    # VISUAL: Torin still holding her hand. Understanding. But still pleading. Still suffering. Still desperate.

    torin "The count includes quality. Not just quantity. Keeping me alive for hours of agony isn't counting the living. That's counting the suffering. Let me go. Let me be counted as someone who died with dignity. Not someone who died screaming. Please."

    # VISUAL: Door opening. AERON entering. Heard voices. Concerned. Then sees scene. Understands immediately. Freezes.

    "{i}Aeron. Here. Why is he here? Doesn't matter. He's here. He sees. He understands. Can see it in his face. Torin dying. Tessa breaking. Choice pending. Death approaching. Mercy requested. Impossible decision. He knows. He's made impossible decisions. Killed 390 people. Saved 23. He knows what killing feels like. What mercy feels like. What impossible choices cost.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron approaches. Quiet. Not intruding. Just present. Supporting. Witnessing.

    a "Tessa. What's happening?"

    # VISUAL: Tessa looking at him. Desperate. Seeking answer. Seeking permission. Seeking anything that makes this bearable.

    t "He's dying. Sepsis. Hours left. Maybe day. Suffering. Conscious. Aware. In pain. And he's asking... he's asking me to make it stop. To end it. To give him mercy. And I don't know what to do. I don't know if that's mercy or murder. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I should. I don't know anything except he's suffering and I can stop it but stopping it means killing and I don't know. I don't know."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. Looking at Torin. Seeing suffering. Seeing plea. Seeing human in agony requesting release. Then looking at Tessa. Seeing breakdown. Seeing impossible choice destroying her.

    a "Torin. This is your choice? You're asking for this? Clearly? Consciously? This is what you want?"

    # VISUAL: Torin nodding. Weak but certain. Clear. Consensual. Chosen.

    torin "Yes. Clearly. Consciously. I'm choosing this. I don't want hours of agony. I want to go now. While I'm still me. While I can still choose. Before pain makes me just screaming animal. Let me choose this. Let me go with dignity. Please."

    # VISUAL: Aeron turning to Tessa. Sees her breaking. Sees impossible choice crushing her. Sees need for support. For permission. For witness.

    a "Tessa. Look at me. This isn't murder. This is mercy. He's choosing. He's consenting. He's requesting release from suffering. That's his right. That's his choice. And honoring that choice? That's compassion. That's respect. That's mercy."

    # VISUAL: Tessa shaking head. Tears flowing. Can't accept. Can't process. Can't reconcile.

    t "But the count. The living. I'm supposed to save people. Not end them. That's my purpose. That's what I do. If I do this, I'm not healer. I'm executioner. I'm killer. I become what I hate."

    # VISUAL: Aeron gentle. Understanding. But firm. Truth necessary.

    a "You told me once: Count the living. You have 370 names on your board. 347 yours. 23 mine. People we saved. People who are alive and whole and functional because we chose to fight for them. That's your count. That's your purpose. That's proof you're healer."
    a "This? This is different. This isn't failing to save. This is honoring choice. He's not asking you to give up. He's asking you to let go. There's difference. Giving up means stopping when there's still hope. Letting go means accepting when there's none. He has no hope. Just suffering. And he's choosing to end that suffering. That's his right. You're just helping him exercise it."

    # VISUAL: Tessa looking at Torin. At his suffering. At his plea. At his choice. Then at her hands. Healer's hands. Or killer's hands? Both? Neither?

    t "What if I'm wrong? What if there's still chance? What if I could save him if I just tried harder? Tried longer? What if giving up now means he dies when he could have lived?"

    # VISUAL: Torin speaking. Weak. Honest. Final. Truth from dying man.

    torin "Tessa. I'm dying. I can feel it. Inside. Everything's shutting down. Everything hurts. I'm not going to make it. You know that. I know that. We all know that. The only question is how. Fast with mercy or slow with agony. That's the choice. Not life or death. Just how death happens. Please. Let it be fast. Let it be mercy. Let it be now. Please."

    # VISUAL: Tessa breaking. Fully. Completely. Crying. Shaking. But also accepting. Understanding. Choosing.

    t "I... I can do that. I can give you that. Mercy. Release. End to suffering. I can do that. But Torin... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I couldn't save you. I'm sorry I failed. I'm sorry this is how it ends."

    # VISUAL: Torin smiling. Small. Grateful. Peaceful. Relief visible.

    torin "You didn't fail. You tried. You cared. You stayed. That's not failure. That's everything. Thank you. For trying. For caring. For staying. For this. For mercy. Thank you."

    # VISUAL: Tessa preparing medication. Hands shaking but moving. Professional even through grief. Preparing final injection. Morphine. Massive dose. Peaceful death. Mercy.

    "{i}She's preparing it. The injection. The mercy. The murder. The compassion. The death. Her hands shake. But they move. Professional. Trained. Efficient. Even now. Even breaking. Even killing. She functions. She completes. She delivers mercy. Because he asked. Because he chose. Because honoring that choice is what healers do. Even when honoring means ending. Even when mercy means death.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa approaching bed. Injection ready. Last chance to stop. Last chance to refuse. Last chance to choose differently. But she doesn't stop. She continues. She's chosen.

    t "Torin. This will be fast. Painless. You'll feel warm. Sleepy. Then nothing. Just nothing. Peaceful. Is this what you want? Last chance to change your mind. Last chance to choose more time. What do you want?"

    # VISUAL: Torin looking at her. Certain. Clear. Chosen. Ready.

    torin "I want peace. I want rest. I want to stop hurting. Give me that. Please. Give me mercy. Give me peace. Let me go."

    # VISUAL: Tessa nodding. Injection ready. Hand steadying. Professional mask returning. Healer delivering mercy. Final mercy.

    t "Then rest. You fought well. You mattered. You were counted among the living. And now you rest. Peacefully. With dignity. With choice. Rest now, Torin. You've earned it."

    # VISUAL: Injection administered. Morphine flowing. Torin's face relaxing. Pain fading. Breathing easier. Peaceful. Then slower. Then stopping. Then nothing. Gone. Dead. Released. Mercy delivered.

    "{i}It's done. He's gone. Breathing stopped. Heart stopped. Pain stopped. Everything stopped. He's dead. She killed him. She delivered mercy. She ended suffering. She broke her count. She saved him from hours of agony. She murdered him. She healed him. She failed him. She honored him. All of it. All at once. All true. All contradictory. All impossible to reconcile. But done. Mercy delivered. Death witnessed. Choice honored.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa standing. Frozen. Staring at body. At hands. At proof. At death. At mercy. At murder. At everything she never wanted to be.

    "{i}She's frozen. Staring. Processing. She just killed someone. Intentionally. Deliberately. Compassionately. She ended a life. Stopped a heart. Delivered death. That's murder. That's also mercy. That's both. That's neither. That's impossible to process. So she stands. She stares. She breaks.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Then collapse. Knees giving. Falling. Crying. Full breakdown. Everything releasing. Grief and guilt and horror and compassion all at once.

    t "(sobbing) I killed him. I’m a healer—and I killed him. Everything I believe in says that’s wrong. I became what I swore to fight. I broke my count. I failed him. I failed myself. I don’t know who I am anymore."


    # VISUAL: Aeron dropping to knees beside her. Holding her. Not speaking yet. Just present. Just supporting. Just witnessing her break.

    "{i}She's breaking. Completely. Everything she believed. Everything she built. Everything she counted. Shattered by one mercy death. One impossible choice. One moment where saving meant killing. She can't reconcile. Can't process. Can't accept. She just breaks. And I hold her. Because that's all I can do. Hold her while she breaks. Witness her pain. Share her burden. That's all anyone can do with impossible choices. Witness them. Share them. Hold each other while they crush us.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Time passing. Minutes. Her sobbing. Him holding. Silent presence. Shared weight. Eventually she speaks. Quiet. Broken. Lost.

    t "I don't know if I did right thing. I don't know if that was mercy or murder. I don't know if I should have done it. If I should have refused. If I should have let him suffer but live longer. I don't know anything. I don't know who I am anymore. Am I healer who kills? Killer who heals? What am I?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron gentle. Careful. Truth offered not forced. Support not solution.

    a "You're human who faced impossible choice. Who chose compassion over dogma. Who honored dying man's request for dignity over rigid principle of preserving life at any cost. That's not murder. That's mercy. Hard mercy. Costly mercy. But mercy."

    # VISUAL: Tessa shaking head. Can't accept. Can't process. Can't reconcile.

    t "But my count. Count the living. That's my philosophy. My purpose. My meaning. I count lives saved. Not lives ended. He's dead. I ended him. That's wrong. That contradicts everything."

    # VISUAL: Aeron holding her tighter. Understanding. Reframing. Offering perspective.

    a "You told me once: *Count the living.* Not the breathing, not the beating hearts—the living. Living means dignity, choice, humanity. He’d stopped living long before you eased his pain. You didn’t end life, you preserved what made it worth counting."

    # VISUAL: Tessa looking up. Tears streaming. Desperate to believe. Desperate for permission to accept what she did.

    t "You really believe that? That what I did was mercy not murder? That I honored him instead of failing him? That this was right choice even though it feels wrong? You believe that?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron meeting her eyes. Honest. Certain. Supporting. Believing.

    a "I believe you made an impossible choice with compassion instead of cruelty. I believe you honored dying man's request for dignity. I believe you're still healer even though you delivered death. Because healing isn't just preventing death. Sometimes healing is making death bearable. Making it peaceful. Making it chosen. That's what you did. That's healing. That's mercy. That's you."

    # VISUAL: Tessa searching his face. Seeking certainty. Seeking permission. Seeking absolution. Finding... acceptance. Not resolution. But acceptance.

    t "I don't know if I believe that. Don't know if I can accept what I did. Don't know if I'll ever think it was right choice. But I know I made it with compassion. I know I honored his request. I know I ended suffering instead of prolonging it. That has to mean something. Has to count for something. Even if it still feels like murder."

    # VISUAL: She stands. Slowly. Shakily. But standing. Functional despite breaking. Moving despite weight.    
    "{i}She leans against me, just for a moment—exhausted, empty, but breathing. The silence that follows isn’t peace, exactly. It’s aftermath. The space where pain stops screaming and starts echoing.{/i}"

    t "I need to add his name. To the board. But not to the living. To... to the other side. The side I never made. The side I never wanted. The dead. The ones I couldn't save. The ones I lost. The ones I failed. He goes there. First name. Won't be last. When Echelon comes? When raids happen? When fighting starts? There will be more. More impossible choices. More mercy deaths. More names on wrong side of board. I need to prepare for that. Need to accept that. Need to be able to do this again if necessary."

    # VISUAL: Moving to board. Her 347 names. His 23 names. 370 living. And now... new section. The dead. Torin. First name. First failure. First mercy. First murder. First of many.

    "{i}She's adding section to board. New section. The dead. Names of people she couldn't save. Torin first. First mercy death. First impossible choice. First name on wrong side. First of many. When war comes? This list grows. This list becomes long. This list becomes weight she carries. Forever. Every name. Every death. Every failure. Every mercy. All of them. Forever. That's cost of resistance. That's price of war. That's weight of healing in combat. She accepts it. She adds the name. She witnesses the cost. She continues anyway.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Writing name. Careful. Precise. Reverent. Torin. Dead. Failed. Mercy. First. Not last.

    t "Torin Vell. Age 22. Resistance fighter. Died of sepsis from training injury. Given mercy. Given choice. Given dignity. Counted among the dead. But counted. Remembered. Honored. That's something. That has to be something."

    # VISUAL: Stepping back. Looking at board. 370 living. 1 dead. Ratio good. For now. But changing. Soon.

    t "When Echelon comes? When raids start? This side grows. Fast. I'll be adding names. Lots of names. People I couldn't save. People who died despite my efforts. People who chose mercy. People who didn't choose anything. All of them. All on this side. All counted among the dead. That's war. That's resistance. That's cost."
    t "But I keep counting. Living and dead. Because both matter. Both deserve to be remembered. Both deserve to be witnessed. Both deserve to be honored. That's what I do. That's who I am. I count. All of them. Living and dead. Always counting. Always witnessing. Always honoring. That's enough. That has to be enough."

    # VISUAL: Aeron standing with her. Looking at board. At Torin's name. At cost made visible. At weight shared.

    a "It's enough. You're enough. What you did was impossible. What you chose was compassion. What you delivered was mercy. That counts. Even on wrong side of board. Especially on wrong side. Because that side takes more courage. More compassion. More strength. You have that. You'll need it. Because you're right. When war comes, this side grows. And you'll keep counting. Keep honoring. Keep witnessing. That's who you are. That's enough. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: They stand together. Looking at board. At count. At living and dead. At cost and hope. At everything resistance means. At everything war costs. Together. Witnessing. Sharing. Continuing.

    "{i}Standing with Tessa. Looking at board. 370 living. 1 dead. First death. First mercy. First impossible choice. First of many. When Echelon comes? When war starts? This ratio flips. This side grows. Names accumulate. Deaths multiply. And she counts them all. Witnesses them all. Honors them all. Because that's what healers do in war. They save who they can. They mercy who they can't. They count everyone. Living and dead. And they carry that weight. Forever. That's Tessa. That's resistance. That's war. That's us.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Tessa turning. Looking at him. Changed. Heavier. But functional. Continuing despite weight.

    t "Thank you. For being here. For witnessing. For supporting. For helping me accept what I did. I don't know if it was right. But I know I'm not alone in it. That matters. That helps. That's everything."

    # VISUAL: Brief moment. Human connection. Shared weight. Then professional mask returning. Healer continuing. Work remaining.

    t "I need to prepare his body. Need to document everything. Need to update records. Need to inform his family if he has any. Need to do all the things that come after death. The paperwork. The process. The witnessing. That's my job. That's what comes after mercy. Administration of death. As clinical as administration of life. Both necessary. Both witnessed. Both counted."

    # VISUAL: She moves to body. Professional. Functional. But hands still shaking. Weight still visible. Break still present. But continuing anyway. That's strength. That's Tessa.

    "{i}She moves again. Working through the shake, through the weight, through the cost. She witnesses, she counts, she continues. That’s what healers do in war: survive the choice and keep healing anyway. Strength through heartbreak. Compassion through ruin. That’s Tessa. That’s enough.{/i}"
