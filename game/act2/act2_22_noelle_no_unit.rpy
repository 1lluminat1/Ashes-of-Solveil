# ACT 2 - Scene 22: Noelle - "No Unit" Moment
# =======================================================


label act2_noelle_no_unit:

    # VISUAL: Base. Late evening. Week after Lyra crisis. Operations room. Noelle working. Again. Always working.
    # LIGHTING: Dim. Most lights off. Her workstation bright. Focused. Intense.
    # SOUND: Quiet. Typing. Data processing. Occasional frustrated sigh.

    "{i}Late evening. Operations room. Noelle at her station. Surrounded by datapads and holographic displays. Working on something. Always working. But tonight feels different. Energy different. She's not just analyzing data. She's analyzing something else. Something internal. Something that's been bothering her for weeks.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron entering. Looking for Noelle specifically. Hasn't seen her much lately. She's been avoiding? Or just busy?

    a "Noelle. You're here late. Again."

    # VISUAL: She jumps slightly. Startled. Was deep in thought. Turns. Looks at him. Strange expression. Calculating? Nervous? Both?

    n "Aeron. Yes. I'm here. Working on... something. Not work exactly. Research. Personal research. Unrelated to resistance operations."

    # VISUAL: She's fidgeting. Unusual. Noelle doesn't fidget. She's methodical. Precise. But right now? Nervous. Definitely nervous.

    a "Personal research? That's new. Usually you're all business. What are you researching?"

    # VISUAL: She hesitates. Looks away. Then back. Decision made. Direct approach. Very Noelle.

    n "You. I'm researching you. Well, not you specifically. My responses to you. My physiological patterns when you're present. My behavioral changes over the past three weeks since our late-night conversation. I'm researching... us. The phenomenon of us."

    # VISUAL: Aeron surprised. She's been analyzing their relationship? For three weeks?

    a "You've been analyzing us? For three weeks?"
    n "Yes. Extensively. I've documented every interaction. Every conversation. Every proximity event. Heart rate. Dopamine levels. Cortisol fluctuations. Oxytocin responses. Sleep pattern disruptions when you're absent. Increased focus when you're present. All measurable. All documented. All analyzed."

    # VISUAL: She pulls up displays. Data. Graphs. Charts. Weeks of analysis. Scientific approach to feelings. Very Noelle.

    n "The data is conclusive. My physiological responses to you have intensified by 34% over the past three weeks. Heart rate elevation increased from 23% to 31%. Dopamine spikes are 47% higher. Oxytocin baseline when you're present has doubled. Sleep efficiency decreased by 18% when you're absent for extended periods."
    n "These are not random fluctuations. These are consistent, measurable patterns indicating significant emotional attachment that's strengthening over time. The data supports the hypothesis that I have feelings for you. Strong feelings. Intensifying feelings."

    # VISUAL: She's presenting this like research findings. Scientific. Analytical. But also vulnerable. Scared. This matters to her.

    a "You've been measuring your feelings. With graphs."
    n "Yes. Because I don't understand them otherwise. Feelings are abstract. Unmeasurable. Unpredictable. But physiological responses aren't. I can measure those. I can track those. I can analyze those. So I did. For three weeks. Trying to understand what's happening to me. What you're doing to me. What we're becoming."

    # VISUAL: Aeron moves closer. Looking at her data. Weeks of work. Charts tracking every interaction. Annotated with observations. This is how Noelle processes emotions. Through data. Through science. Through measurement.

    a "What did you conclude? From all this research?"
    n "I concluded that I'm experiencing romantic attraction. Significant romantic attraction. The kind that disrupts normal functioning. The kind that makes me think about you when I should be working. The kind that makes me want to be near you even when it's operationally inefficient. The kind that makes me... happy. When you're here. And unhappy when you're not. That's romantic attraction. That's what the data indicates."

    # VISUAL: She's looking at him. Direct. Honest. Vulnerable in her own analytical way.

    n "But here's the problem. I don't have a framework for what to do with this information. I've identified the phenomenon. I've measured it. I've analyzed it. I've concluded it exists and is intensifying. But I don't know what comes next. I don't have a protocol. I don't have a model. I don't have a unit for measuring what to do about romantic attraction once you've identified it."

    # VISUAL: She's frustrated. Genuinely frustrated. She solved the problem analytically but doesn't know the next step emotionally.

    n "There's no unit for this. No formula. No algorithm. I can tell you exactly how much my heart rate increases when you enter a room. I can quantify the dopamine response when you smile. I can measure the oxytocin elevation when we work together. But I can't quantify what I'm supposed to DO with that information. That's unmeasurable. That's the problem. There's no unit."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. She just confessed feelings. Using data. Using graphs. Using three weeks of research. This is the most Noelle confession possible. And it's perfect.

    a "You're trying to create a formula for romance. A measurable protocol for what to do when you have feelings."
    n "Yes. Because that's how I understand things. Through measurement. Through analysis. Through data. But romance doesn't work that way. It's not measurable. It's not predictable. It's not quantifiable. And that's terrifying. I don't know how to function in unmeasurable space. I don't know how to navigate variables I can't control. I don't know how to do this."

    # VISUAL: She's vulnerable. Actually scared. Not of feelings themselves. Of not knowing how to handle them.

    n "I've spent three weeks trying to develop a protocol. Step one: Identify feelings. Complete. Step two: Analyze feelings. Complete. Step three: Act on feelings. Incomplete. I can't complete step three because I don't know what action is appropriate. What's the correct response to romantic attraction? What's the optimal approach? What's the probability of success versus failure? I don't have data for this. I don't have models. I don't have anything except feelings that resist every attempt to quantify them."

    # VISUAL: Aeron sits. Next to her. Close. Comfortable. Gentle. Understanding.

    a "Maybe that's the point. Maybe feelings aren't supposed to be quantified. Maybe you just... feel them. And act on them. Without knowing the outcome. Without controlling the variables. Just trying. Just experiencing. Just being present with uncertainty."
    n "That's an unacceptable level of uncertainty. I don't function well in uncertainty. I need parameters. I need probabilities. I need measurable outcomes. Just 'trying' without knowing probable results is inefficient. It's risky. It's terrifying."

    # VISUAL: Aeron takes her hand. Gentle. Physical contact. She doesn't pull away. Looks at their hands. Analyzes. Then stops analyzing. Just feels.

    a "What's your heart rate right now?"
    n "(checking internal awareness) Elevated. 34% above baseline. Consistent with previous proximity events."
    a "And dopamine?"
    n "Spiking. Approximately 50% increase from resting state. Also consistent with pattern."
    a "And how does that feel? Not the numbers. The feeling. What does 34% elevated heart rate and 50% dopamine spike feel like?"

    # VISUAL: She's processing. Trying to articulate feeling instead of data. Difficult. Unfamiliar. But trying.

    n "It feels... warm. Pleasant. Comfortable but also exciting. Safe but also uncertain. I want to stay here. In this moment. With you. Holding hands. Not analyzing. Just experiencing. That's new. That's unusual. That's... nice. 89% nice. Maybe 92%."

    # VISUAL: She catches herself. Stops. Laughs. Small. Self-aware. She's quantifying again.

    n "I'm doing it again. Quantifying. I can't help it. That's how my brain works. Everything becomes percentages and probabilities. Even nice moments become data points."
    a "That's okay. That's you. That's Noelle. Analytical, precise, data-driven. I like that about you. You don't have to stop being you to have feelings. You just have to accept that feelings don't always fit into spreadsheets."

    # VISUAL: She's looking at him. Really looking. Not analyzing. Just seeing. Appreciating. Feeling.

    n "I don't know how to do this. Romance. Relationships. Emotional vulnerability. I'm good at data. I'm terrible at feelings. But I want to try. With you. Because the data indicates that you make me happy. And logically, pursuing things that make you happy is optimal behavior. So I want to pursue this. Pursue us. Even though I don't have a protocol. Even though I'm terrified. Even though there's no unit for measuring success probability."

    # VISUAL: She takes breath. Direct approach. Noelle-style. Awkward but genuine.

    n "Research indicates that physical contact is appropriate when expressing romantic interest. Hand-holding has been achieved. Next escalation point is typically kissing. Probability of successful kissing is difficult to calculate without prior experience data, but theoretical models suggest mutual consent is primary variable."

    # VISUAL: She's blushing. Actually blushing. Noelle is trying to ask for a kiss using scientific terminology. It's adorable. It's awkward. It's perfect.

    n "What I'm attempting to communicate, in highly inefficient manner, is that I would like to initiate physical intimacy escalation. Specifically kissing. If that's acceptable to you. If consent is granted. If the variables align favorably."

    # VISUAL: Aeron smiling. She just asked him to kiss her using research terminology. Most Noelle thing possible.

    a "Are you asking me to kiss you? Using scientific methodology?"
    n "(embarrassed but determined) Yes. Because that's the only way I know how to ask. Direct. Analytical. Awkward. But honest. I want to kiss you. I've wanted to kiss you for 17 days, 8 hours, and approximately 32 minutes. Since the night we solved the neural conditioning algorithm. But I didn't know how to initiate. Didn't have protocol. Didn't know if the feeling was mutual. So I researched. Analyzed. Measured. And concluded that mutual attraction probability is 87%. Which is high enough to attempt initiation."

    # VISUAL: She's looking at him. Hopeful. Scared. Vulnerable. Waiting for response. For data. For answer.

    n "Is it? Mutual? Do you experience similar physiological responses? Similar emotional disruption? Similar desire for proximity and physical contact? Because if not, I've miscalculated. And I'll need to recalibrate my models. And probably experience significant embarrassment. Which I'm already experiencing. At approximately 78% intensity. Possibly 83%."

    # VISUAL: Aeron laughs. Gentle. Not mocking. Appreciating. She's perfect. Awkward and analytical and perfect.

    a "Yes. It's mutual. I experience elevated heart rate when you're around. I think about you when I should be thinking about other things. I want to be near you. I want to work with you. I want to talk with you. I want to kiss you. Very much want to kiss you. The feeling is absolutely mutual."

    # VISUAL: Her eyes widen. Relief. Joy. Surprise. Data confirmed. Hypothesis supported. Mutual attraction verified.

    n "Mutual attraction confirmed. That's... that's optimal outcome. That's 98% pleasant. Possibly 100%. That's—"

    # VISUAL: Aeron stops her. Gently. Finger to her lips. Smiling.

    a "Stop analyzing. Just feel. Just be here. Just let this happen without measuring it."

    # VISUAL: She nods. Stops talking. Stops calculating. Just present. Just feeling. Just ready.

    n "Okay. No analyzing. Just feeling. Just experiencing. Just... this."

    # VISUAL: Aeron leans in. Slowly. Giving her time. Letting her adjust. Letting her be ready. Not rushing.

    # VISUAL: Noelle leans in too. Meeting halfway. Nervous but determined. Uncertain but willing. Trying. Together.

    # VISUAL: They kiss. Soft. Tentative. First kiss. Gentle. Sweet. Perfect. Noelle's first romantic kiss. Measured in data for three weeks. Now happening. Now real.

    "{i}Kissing Noelle. She's tense. Uncertain. Analytical brain trying to catalog experience even as it happens. But also present. Also feeling. Also here. She tastes like coffee and determination. She's careful. Precise. Even in kissing. Very Noelle. Very perfect.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Kiss continuing. She relaxes. Stops analyzing. Starts feeling. Hands moving to his shoulders. Tentative but growing confident. Learning. Experiencing. Enjoying.

    "{i}She's relaxing. Learning the rhythm. The connection. The experience of kissing without quantifying it. Her hands on my shoulders. Gentle. Exploring. Testing. Finding what feels good. What feels right. She's a quick learner. Even in this. Even in unmeasurable territory. She's finding her way. Finding us.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Finally pulling apart. Slowly. Gently. Eyes opening. Looking at each other. Changed. Connected. Together.

    n "(breathless) That was... that was unmeasurable. There's no unit for that. No data point. No quantifiable metric. That was just... feeling. Pure feeling. And it was..."
    n "It was 100% pleasant. Definitely 100%. Possibly exceeding measurable scale. Off the charts. That's... that's the first time I've experienced something that breaks my measurement system. That's significant. That's important. That's... perfect."

    # VISUAL: She's smiling. Genuine. Rare. Beautiful. Not analyzing. Just happy. Just present. Just feeling.

    a "How are you feeling? Not the percentage. The actual feeling. What does this feel like?"
    n "It feels like I found something I didn't know I was looking for. Something that doesn't fit into any model or framework I have. Something that's just... good. Just right. Just real. I feel happy. Actually happy. Not contentment. Not satisfaction. Actual happiness. That's new. That's unusual. That's... you. You make me happy. In ways I can't quantify. In ways I don't need to quantify. In ways that just are."

    # VISUAL: She's looking at their hands. Still connected. Physical contact maintained. Comfortable. Natural.

    n "I don't know what comes next. I don't have a protocol for 'after first kiss.' I don't have models for relationship maintenance. I don't have data on optimal courtship strategies. I'm completely outside my operational parameters. But I don't care. I want to keep trying. Keep experiencing. Keep being with you. Protocol or no protocol. Data or no data. Just us. Whatever that becomes."

    # VISUAL: Aeron pulls her closer. Hug. Gentle. Comfortable. She leans into it. Allowing comfort. Allowing closeness. Allowing feelings without measurement.

    a "We'll figure it out together. No protocols. No models. No formulas. Just trying. Just learning. Just being together. That's enough. That's all we need."
    n "Just being together. That's sufficient. That's optimal. That's... perfect. Yes. That works. That's acceptable. Actually, that's more than acceptable. That's ideal. That's what I want. Just us. Together. Figuring it out. No units required."

    # VISUAL: They sit together. Close. Comfortable. Her head on his shoulder. His arm around her. Silent. Content. Connected.

    "{i}Sitting with Noelle. Her head on my shoulder. My arm around her. She's not talking. Not analyzing. Not measuring. Just existing. Just being present. Just feeling. That's growth. That's trust. That's her learning to exist in unmeasurable space. With me. Together. That's everything.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Time passing. Minutes. Comfortable silence. Then Noelle speaks. Soft. Thoughtful. Content.

    n "Thank you. For being patient. For accepting my analytical approach to feelings. For not making fun of my graphs and measurements. For understanding that this is how I process things. For kissing me even though I asked using research terminology. For being you. That's... that's important to me. You're important to me."

    # VISUAL: Aeron smiling. She's perfect. Awkward and brilliant and perfect.

    a "You're important to me too. Your graphs and measurements and analytical approach included. I wouldn't change anything about you. You're perfect exactly as you are. Data-driven romance and all."
    n "Data-driven romance. I like that term. That's accurate. That's me. Approaching emotions like experiments. Measuring feelings like variables. Loving you like a research project. Except better. Because research projects end. This doesn't. This continues. This grows. This matters. You matter. We matter. That's unmeasurable but true. That's the most important data point of all."

    # VISUAL: She turns. Looks at him. Eyes clear. Certain. Decided.

    n "I love you. In quantifiable and unquantifiable ways. In measurable and immeasurable metrics. In ways that fit spreadsheets and ways that break all my models. I love you. That's the conclusion. That's the result. That's the data I've been collecting for three weeks. I love you. Probability: 100%. Certainty: absolute. Duration: indefinite. Status: mutual. That's everything I needed to know. That's perfect."

    # VISUAL: Aeron processing. She said it. I love you. Using data terminology. But also meaning it. Deeply. Really. Truly.

    a "I love you too. In all the unmeasurable ways. In all the ways that don't fit into graphs. In all the ways that just are. I love you. No percentages needed. No data required. Just truth. Just feeling. Just us."

    # VISUAL: She kisses him again. Initiated by her. Confident now. Learning. Growing. Choosing. Together.

    "{i}She kisses me. Again. More confident. More certain. More present. She's learning. She's growing. She's choosing this. Choosing me. Choosing us. Choosing to exist in unmeasurable space because it's worth it. Because we're worth it. Because love is worth it. That's growth. That's trust. That's everything.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Kiss ending. Comfortable. Real. Changed. Together. Forward.

    n "I should probably return to actual work. Resistance operations. Data analysis that's not about us. Optimal resource allocation. That's my job. I should do that."
    n "(pause) But I don't want to. I want to stay here. With you. In this moment. Being unmeasured and unmeasurable. Just a little longer. Is that acceptable? Can we have just a little more time before returning to productivity?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron laughing. She's asking permission to keep being unproductive because she's happy. Most un-Noelle thing ever. Most perfect thing ever.

    a "Yeah. We can have more time. As much time as you want. Productivity can wait. This matters more."
    n "This matters more. Yes. Agreed. Optimal prioritization. Love before work. Us before productivity. That's... that's good. That's right. That's perfect."

    # VISUAL: They settle back. Together. Comfortable. Content. Just being. Just existing. Just loving. No units. No measurements. Just them.

    "{i}Sitting with Noelle. Operations room dark except her workstation. Data everywhere. Graphs measuring feelings. Three weeks of research. All leading to this. To us. To love. To unmeasurable space that she's learning to navigate. Together. She's perfect. Analytical and awkward and brilliant and perfect. And she loves me. That's unmeasurable. That's everything. That's 100% pleasant. Possibly infinity percent. No unit for measuring happiness this complete. Just happiness. Just us. Just perfect.{/i}"
