    "{i}Night. Hours after evacuation. Secondary base. Sector 9. Vex’s location. We’re here. Alive. Exhausted. Wounded. Traumatized. But alive. That’s everything. That’s all that matters. Just alive. Just breathing. Just continuing. That’s victory. That’s enough.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Base settling. People finding spaces. Sleeping where they can. Wounded being treated. Exhaustion everywhere.
    # MOOD: Survival’s cost, collective silence.

    "{i}People everywhere. Sleeping on floors, against walls, wherever space exists. Wounded treated in makeshift stations. Fighters too tired to move. Just existing. Just recovering. War happened. We survived. That’s all anyone can process. Just survival. Just breath. Just continuing.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: AERON sitting alone. Corner of base. Shadowed, withdrawn.
    # MOOD: Survivor’s guilt.

    "{i}I sit alone in a corner—away from noise, away from people. Forty dead. Forty names. Forty people I recruited. Forty people who believed me. Their deaths are mine to carry. I break under it, but I don’t stop. If I stop, they died for nothing. If I continue, they died for something. So I continue. I carry. I break. I continue. That’s all I can do.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA approaching. Exhausted, bloodied, bandaged arm. Quiet presence.
    # SOUND: The low hum of generators, distant murmurs of the wounded.

    "{i}Zira approaches. Quiet. Exhausted. Her uniform still smells of smoke; a blood-soaked bandage wraps her arm. The air between us tastes like ash. Romance shouldn’t exist here—but somehow it does. She sits beside me. We don’t speak. We just breathe the same burnt air and exist in it together. Two people too tired for words, too human for silence. That’s enough—for now.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Long silence. Both breathing, staring ahead.
    # LIGHTING: Faint red emergency glow across their faces.
    # TONE: Shared trauma turned into shared presence.

    "{i}Minutes pass. Still silence. Still breathing. That’s all either of us can offer: presence. Witness. Shared weight. She saw things today. Killed people. I lost people. Both of us carrying too much, both barely holding. But together. That’s connection in war—not perfect, just real.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA breaking silence. Exhausted honesty.
    # SOUND: Distant echo of metal clatter; otherwise quiet.

    z "I killed three people today. Directly. With explosives. Watched them fall. Watched them stop. I killed them. That’s murder. That’s also war. Both truths live in me now."

    # VISUAL: AERON listening. Shadowed expression, understanding.
    # TONE: Shared burden through acknowledgment.

    a "Forty died under my command. My decisions. My responsibility. Their deaths sit on my chest. That’s burden. That’s war. Both truths live in me too."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA reflecting on Kai. Past trauma surfacing.
    # LIGHTING: Slight flicker in emergency lights as she speaks.

    z "Kai died alone. I couldn’t save him. I wasn’t there. He died, and I wasn’t there. That’s haunted me for four years—this belief that everyone I care about dies, that everyone I love leaves. That pattern made me keep you distant. Undefined. Uncertain. Because if I never had you completely, I couldn’t lose you completely. That’s protection. That’s cowardice. And I’m so tired of it."

    # VISUAL: Small pause. Her gaze turns inward, distant.
    # SOUND: Subtle ambient drone; tension before confession.

    z "Today I thought you died—three times. Once when the north perimeter fell and you were still out there. Once when comms went dark. Once when the tunnels filled with smoke. Three times I thought you were gone, and three times you weren’t. And every time, something in me broke and rebuilt differently."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA gathering courage. Breath trembling. Words deliberate.
    # LIGHTING: Harsh red tone softens slightly as if reflecting vulnerability.

    z "I love you. Not uncertain. Not distant. Real. Committed. Terrifying. The kind that makes your survival everything and losing you unthinkable. I’m done pretending otherwise."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA leaning forward, eyes wet. Emotion cresting.
    # THEME: Fear of loss vs. choice to love anyway.

    z "Losing you hurts whether I’m distant or close. Protection doesn’t protect—it just steals what little time I could have had with you. So I’m done half-living. I’m done halfway loving. I’d rather have you completely and lose you than never have you at all."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA taking his hand. Decision made. Clear eyes.
    # LIGHTING: Faint red reflection in tears.

    z "I’m choosing you. Fully. Completely. No more uncertainty. No more distance. No more pretending I don’t care this much. However long we have, however it ends—I’m choosing you now. After war. After blood. After death. I’m choosing life. I’m choosing love. I’m choosing you. Is that what you want? Do you choose me too—knowing what it costs?"

    # VISUAL: AERON watching her. Overwhelmed but calm.
    # SOUND: Heartbeat-like thrum from base machinery.

    "{i}She’s trembling—not from fear, but from honesty. The bravest thing I’ve ever seen isn’t on a battlefield; it’s her, right now, risking everything for love. And she’s waiting—for me to risk it too.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: AERON answering quietly but firmly. Tone of truth.
    # LIGHTING: Gentle contrast—cool shadows vs. red light.

    a "Yes. I choose you. Not because it’s safe or easy—but because it’s real. Because it’s you. Because even if we only get a little time, I’d rather spend it with you than survive without you. You’re worth the risk, the terror, all of it. I choose you. Every time."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA exhaling. Shoulders drop. Relief and tears.
    # SOUND: A soft exhale audible; silence after storm.

    "{i}She exhales like she’s been holding her breath since the war began. Tears glint in the dim red light. We don’t need more words; we already said everything that matters.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Their first kiss. Desperate and human.
    # LIGHTING: Red glow flickering, reflecting intensity.
    # SOUND: Ambient hum fading beneath their movement.

    "{i}She leans in. I meet her halfway. The first kiss tastes of smoke and salt and survival. It isn’t gentle—it’s proof we’re still alive. She’s trembling; so am I. The world outside keeps burning, but here, in this flickering dark, we make something else: a moment that’s ours.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA pulling back slightly. Tears and resolve.
    # THEME: Fear coexisting with certainty.

    z "I’m terrified. Of losing you. Of war taking you like it took Kai. But fear just makes me hold tighter. It reminds me this is real, that you’re real, that I’m alive enough to be afraid. War teaches us one thing: love hard while we can. Don’t waste time. Don’t protect. Just love."

    # VISUAL: AERON answering. Eyes soft, voice low.
    # SOUND: Generator hum steady in background.

    a "I’m terrified too. Forty people died today. Tomorrow it could be me. Or you. Or both. That’s what makes this matter. Terror doesn’t kill love—it sharpens it. Makes every second mean something. I love you more because I might lose you, not less."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA whispering. Request as confession.
    # LIGHTING: Dim red fading to shadow.

    z "Then kiss me again. Not carefully. Not like I’m fragile. Kiss me like we survived. Like we chose each other."

    # VISUAL: AERON pulling her close. Urgent kiss.
    # SOUND: Brief silence except their breathing.

    "{i}I pull her close. The kiss is desperate, alive, full of everything we’re too broken to say. She tastes like dust and blood and something achingly human. For the first time since the war began, I feel alive instead of just surviving.{/i}"

    # ============================================================== 
    # INTIMATE SCENE SETUP
    # ==============================================================

    # VISUAL: Private space found. Empty room, faint light from corridor.
    # SOUND: Distant generator hum; faint wind through cracks.

    scene bg_private_space with fade

    "{i}We find a private room—small, quiet, smelling of metal and dust. Outside, a generator hums and someone coughs. The world keeps burning, but for one breath, we reclaim a piece of it for ourselves.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA nervous, honest confession before intimacy.
    # LIGHTING: Soft red fading to amber glow from portable lamp.

    z "I haven’t done this before. Not really. The others never mattered. You’re first—and only. That’s terrifying. That’s also right."

    # VISUAL: AERON reassuring. Tone gentle, steady.

    a "I’m nervous too. This is the first time it’s love. The first time it feels like something that could save me. We’ll figure it out together. Always together, okay?"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA smiling faintly, tearful.
    # SOUND: Heartbeat-like thrum of nearby machinery.

    z "Together. Always together. That’s us. That’s how we survive. That’s how we love. I need you now. I need us now."

    # VISUAL: Their movements. Slow. Careful. Certain.
    # LIGHTING: Warm shadows, intimate atmosphere.

    "{i}We move together—slow, uncertain, certain. Touching, learning, breathing. Fear and tenderness share the same heartbeat. The war fades beyond the walls. The only sound left is breath, the only truth left is us.{/i}"

    # FADE TO BLACK for explicit intimacy
    # SOUND: Faint breath, fade to silence.

    scene black with fade

    "{i}Together. Fully. Completely. Committed. Real. Everything we are. Everything we choose. For tonight, there is no war—only this. Only us.{/i}"

    # ============================================================== 
    # POST-INTIMACY AFTERMATH
    # ==============================================================

    # VISUAL: Aftermath. Soft light returning. Bodies intertwined.
    # LIGHTING: Low amber glow from emergency lamp.
    # SOUND: Faint hum, rhythmic breathing.

    scene bg_private_space_after with fade

    "{i}Afterwards. We lie tangled in the dark, skin warm against cold air. Exhausted. Fulfilled. Alive. The base groans somewhere distant; life continues beyond these walls, but here it finally pauses. Here there’s quiet. Here there’s love.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: ZIRA speaking softly, half-asleep smile.

    z "(quiet) That was everything. Real. Committed. Perfect. I’m glad it was you. I’m glad we survived long enough to have this. You’re everything."

    # VISUAL: AERON tightening his hold, voice low, genuine.

    a "Thank you for choosing me—despite the fear, despite the war. I love you. Fully, completely, for as long as we get. Whatever tomorrow looks like, you have all of me."

    # VISUAL: ZIRA replying, eyes closed, peaceful.

    z "And you have me. Completely. Whatever time we have, it’s ours. That’s real. That’s enough."

    # VISUAL: Both drifting into sleep. Shadows softening.
    # SOUND: Faint static from comms in distance; otherwise silence.

    "{i}Sleep finds us. War still breathes beyond the walls, but here there’s peace. Tomorrow the fight returns—but tonight, we’re human again. That’s enough.{/i}"
