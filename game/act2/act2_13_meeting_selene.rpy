    # VISUAL: Figures emerge from ruins. Armed. Cautious. Resistance fighters.
    # 4-5 people. Battle-worn. Survivors. Angry. Grieving. Dangerous.

    "{i}Movement. Figures emerging from cover. Armed. Four of them. Maybe five. Hard to tell in the shadows. All pointing weapons at us.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Aeron and Lyra stop. Hands visible. Not reaching for weapons. Non-threatening.
    l "(quiet) Five visible. Probably more we can't see."
    a "Definitely more. Snipers on rooftops. Flankers in ruins. She's smart."
    l "Or paranoid."
    a "Down here, they're the same thing."

    # VISUAL: Resistance fighters part. Woman walks through. Mid-30s. Scarred. Exhausted. Determined.
    # SELENE: Leader. Survivor. Epitome of determination despite everything lost.

    "{i}They part. One woman walks forward. Mid-thirties, scarred face, eyes that have seen too much death. This is Selene. The woman whose people I killed. Whose sector I swept. Who lost everything twice—once to me, once to the Purge.{/i}"

    # VISUAL: Selene stops. Ten feet away. Evaluating. Cold. Professional.
    selene "Glass."
    a "Not anymore. Aeron. Aeron Rylan."
    selene "Names don't change what you did. Glass, Aeron, doesn't matter. You swept my sector. Killed 600 people in one night."
    a "I did. I'm not denying it. I'm not defending it. I did it."
    selene "At least you're honest. Most killers make excuses."

    # VISUAL: She looks at Lyra. Recognizing. Cold calculation.
    selene "And you. Echelon's perfect soldier. Proof the system works. I know your face. Seen it on propaganda screens."
    l "That's not who I am anymore."
    selene "No? Then who are you? Because right now you look like two Echelon defectors trying to hide in my territory."
    l "We're people who want to burn Echelon down. Same as you."
    selene "You don't get to want that. You WERE Echelon. You built the machine. Now you want to destroy it because it turned on you?"
    selene "That's not resistance. That's revenge."

    # VISUAL: Aeron doesn't flinch. Accepts the accusation. Truth in it.
    a "Maybe it started as revenge. But it's more now. Echelon murdered 100,000 people in the Purge. My mercy triggered it but Marcus ordered it."
    a "That's not a system worth serving. That's not a city worth protecting. That's genocide wearing order's mask."
    selene "And you suddenly care? After years of killing for them?"
    a "No. Not suddenly. Slowly. Piece by piece. Until I cracked completely and couldn't do it anymore."
    a "I'm not asking forgiveness. I'm asking for a chance to do something that matters. To stop them from doing it again."

    # VISUAL: Selene studies them. Long silence. Tension building. Decision pending.
    selene "Zira vouched for you. Said you completed every task she set. Worked honestly. Helped people. Confronted your past."
    selene "Is that true?"
    a "Yes. Every task. Every single one."
    selene "Why? Why do all that? Why not just run? Hide? Disappear into the Unders and hope nobody finds you?"
    a "Because hiding isn't surviving. And surviving isn't living. I want to do something that matters before I die."
    a "I want to count the living instead of the dead. I want to build instead of break. I want to be someone other than Glass."

    # VISUAL: Selene's expression shifts. Slight. Barely noticeable. But something softens.
    selene "Tessa's philosophy. 'Count the living.' She mentioned you. Said you might be worth saving."
    selene "Noelle said your instincts are solid. That you think like Echelon but fight like resistance."
    selene "Even the people you hurt vouched for you. Survivors from your Sweep. Said you saved 200 when you could have killed them all."
    selene "That's why I'm here. Not because I trust you. But because people I trust say you might be useful."

    # VISUAL: She steps closer. Eyes hard. Testing.
    selene "So here's the deal. I don't trust you. I don't like you. And if you fuck up even once, I'll kill you myself."
    selene "But I need soldiers. I need people who know Echelon. And I need people desperate enough to actually fight instead of just survive."
    selene "You fit all three. So I'm willing to give you one chance. One. You waste it, you die. Clear?"

    # VISUAL: Aeron nods. Accepting. Grateful despite harsh terms.
